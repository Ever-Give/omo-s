(This is my first time writing fanfics, if you guys find any english/narrative errors, please warn me. Thanks)

This is a story about Emily, a girl at her 20s, doing college, but with a great problem: A weak bladder, she had this problem since she was 10, however it was not a problem since she was really careful and was always close to a bathroom, however this changed when she entered a new college.

Emily woke up 5 AM to prepare and go to the new college, extremely hyped to see how it would go, brushed the teeth, took a shower, and chose the most beautiful clothes in her house, her trademark small black skirt, a simple, but elegant white shirt, a pair of dark blue shoes that fits perfectly with the ice white socks, she was ready to go! The first class was going to begin in 15 minutes and everything was going well, however, Emily did not look where the bathroom was, or how much time she would spend in class, so it was really dangerous, however she was feeling confident that everything would go well!

The class began, it was chemistry, the teacher was talking about properties of the liquids, and by the 1 hour mark it was beggining to affect Emily, a girl that sat next to her saw that emily was nervous and asked:

- "Something wrong?"

- "No, nothing really, haha" Said Emily

Emily was trying to be optimistic, however things weren't looking good for her, the pression was building, the clock was ticking, and the teacher was still talking about liquids, the same girl looked to Emily once again and said:

- "I know what you are going through, this expression is really obvious" And did a strange smile to Emily

- "Wh-WHAT?"

- "HAHA, Just kidding, your face was HILARIOUS, why are you so scared? lol."

- "ITS NOTHING, really its nothing."

- "If you say so, oh by the way, what's your name?"

- "M-my name is Emily, and yours?"

- "Mine is sarah, nice to meet you."

- "The pleasure is mine"

Emily was starting to get really sweaty, even more when the teacher began really using liquids in the class, so emily tried talking to the teacher

- "C-can I go to the bathroom please?"

- "No, you had your chance to go to the bathroom before my class started."

- "B-But its a emergency, please"

- "No, there are no emergencies in my class."

- "Tough luck huh?" Said Sarah

- "Y-yeah." Said emily with more sweat than ever

- "Why don't you just piss yourself?"

- "WHAT??"

- "That's what you heard"

- "W-Why would I do that Sarah?"

- "Because you are almost exploding, and there is still 1 hour of chemistry, AND it is about liquids, you are not going to hold it Emily, I couldn't hold it" She says this while pointing at her crotch, it is completely soaked

Emily, with a shocked expression says

- "I-im not going to do that, never!"

- "Let's see them."

The clock continues ticking, Emily is at her limit, however, luck is by her side, and the bell rings

- "YES!" Says Emily, extremely happy

Emily begins to run to get out of class, but, she doesn't know where the bathroom is, so Emily asks sarah:

- "SARAH WHERE IS THE BATHROOM."

- "Is at the other side of the school" Says sarah with a wry smile

- "OK BYE, SEE YOU SOON."

Emily begins to rush through the corridors, making funny movements to hold it, the school was looking like a maze, she was desperate, every single move she did felt like the floodgates where going to open, but them, she found the bathroom.

There was a line of 5 girls already, the new college had only 1 bathroom, Sarah just laughed at Emily and began talking:

- "Tough luck again uh."

- "DON'T LAUGH, THIS IS NOT FUNNY"

- "I was just like you sometime ago."

- "SHUT UP."

- "Follow me if you don't want the entire school seeing you peeing yourself"

- "I WILL HOLD IT UNTIL THIS LINE ENDS!"

- "Good luck."

And so, time passed, and the girl that was in the bathroom says

"The bathroom is not working anymore, it broke"

Emily just ran to Sarah and asked about what Sarah wanted with her

- "Sarah HELP MEE."

- "Fine, fine, follow me."

Sarah took Emily to a empty place in the school and said

- "Piss yourself."

- "B-but"

- "PEE."

Sarah's voice was so frightening, and the pression was already so high that Emily just began peeing herself, the puddle began, and her pantie was getting soaking wet, the only thing that made Emily a little less sad was that she was wearing a skirt, the pee was not stopping, Emily was peeing for minutes straight, and Sarah had a huge smile on her face, the puddle on the concrete was huge too, and Emily was red as a tomato, Emily tried hiding her Crotch area but it was useless, Sarah had already seen everything, and she said

"That was awesome for a little girl like you.'

"SHUT UP."

- "I have a weak bladder too, but I-"

- "BUT YOU DON'T HAVE SHAME ON YOURSELF!?"

- "Calm down there girl."

Emily is still shocked of everything that happened on her first day of college, and despise what Emily's saying, She is pretty grateful that Sarah showed a place with no one around to look at her peeing

- "T-thanks at least for taking me on a place that don't have people looking."

- "No problem girl, i will show you more things with the time, we are 2 girls with weak bladders, we need to help each other right?"

- "Y-yes, sure."

Sarah and Emily hug each other as a symbol of their friendship, and prepare for the next class.
