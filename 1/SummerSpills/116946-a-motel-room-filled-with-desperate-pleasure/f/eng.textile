A motel room filled with desperate pleasure

Alright, I'm gonna try jump right in with one of my stories (just one scene, really, but a longer one, so I'm gonna split it into pieces as I've seen done on here quite often and will update as I progress in writing/transcribing). Hope it gets approved 🤞🏼 (I've seen other intense stories on here, so I hope it will, but I'm still weary with posting the darker stuff I write) and some love 😇. Word of warning: It is consensual, but I do have a thing for dom/sub dynamics, and it might get quite intense (at least for my standards, dunno what yours are yet😅). And I'm always really unsure about tagging correctly (and if I should tag the crucial points upfront already or only as I post the content they refer to). If you got suggestions for me there, please, feel free to educate me ;-). And now, I just stop blabbering (as I always do when nervous) and start right into part 1 and hope you like it.

Ah, yes, might wanna add, this one was actually inspired by something I read on here quite a while ago. No full story. Just someone mentioning a story they once read I think. Not the same dynamics between the characters, but it was a motel room. And being forced to hold. And... well, you'll see. I just had to take the idea and dig my teeth into it 😇

###

The motel room was quiet in that peculiar way. Thin walls. Humming heater. Faded yellow light from the lamp. A simple bed. A sink. A small window. The fringed blinds shut. The kind of space made for anonymity and secrets that weren't supposed to leave those four blotched walls. Yet inside it, there was no pretence. Just the buzz of something raw and wicked, pressed tight between them. Too tight.

Joanna still stood by the closed door. The tension in her thighs barely concealed. Waves of faint tremors running through her as the feeling sank in that she was trapped. That this room didn't hold the promise for the relief she so craved.

He had locked the door, and the key had vanished inside his pocket, but as far as it concerned her, he could just as well have tossed it out of the window. He held the key to her relief, and it wasn't made of metal, but of power. He had it. She didn't.

She shifted her weight, her mind running through all the possibilities to relieve herself despite the lack of a bathroom, whether she wanted to have those thoughts or not. She didn't, but at a certain point, her mind stopped caring about what she wanted. Sooner or later, her body would as well, but she wasn't quite there - yet.

The sink. The bed. One of the four corners of the shabby room without any cover to hide her shame behind. Or simply in her pants right where she stood.

Joanna swallowed hard. Swallowed those thoughts that tempted her too much. Swallowed the dryness in her mouth that opposed the drenched state of her mind. The taste of desperation creeping up her throat. And David, calmly seated on the edge of the bed, tilted his head, his undivided attention weighing down on her heavily. His eyes didn't miss a thing. Not the way she clenched her jaw. Not the way her hands hovered, unsure whether to cover herself or clutch something for composure.

She knew that at this point of desperately clinging to her self-restraint, her every thought was plainly written out for him all over her face and body. And no matter how despicable or shameful, he could and would read it. The subtly mocking smirk curving his lips told her he just did.

“I will let you pick a spot afterwards,” he said, voice low and measured, giving her hope just to tear it from her again. Afterwards… The promise and threat of that made her knees go a little weaker, and her breath caught in her throat. She didn't know when that afterwards would be. Or what he would do to her until then. But she knew it wouldn't be pretty.

“I don't think I can hold it that long anymore,” she murmured. Her breath more gasping than flowing steadily. Her voice feeble.

He stood slowly. Closing the space between them without hurry. His deliberately controlled pace mocking the pressing urgency of her need. And with every inch between them melting away, she felt his presence pushing against her belly harder long before he touched her.

“You said that before you got in the car already, and yet, you're still holding it,” he said. Unimpressed. Uttering a simple statement. His words not cruel but very deliberately chosen to remind her of both her strength and the urgency of her need.

“Because I had no other choice.” Her voice was barely above a breath, and her knees instinctively pressed together tighter, thinking about the long way here. The car ride. The faint but constant vibration of the seat under her. The occasional bumps in the road. That one time when he'd had to brake unexpectedly, and the seatbelt had dug into her belly so cruelly that she’d almost ruined his posh leather seat.

She swallowed hard, trying not to think about the torment along the way. This moment was torment enough. But her mind wasn't doing her bidding anymore, and she wondered how long her body still would.

She couldn't help but think about the effort it had taken not to wobble all the way from the car to the motel, so nobody would see that she desperately needed a toilet, but she'd stopped wasting her strength reserves on superficial appearances the moment they'd stepped around the corner and out of the receptionist's sight. She was sure in this place, he'd seen it all already, and more, and yet, David was the only one who was supposed to look her through.

“You always have a choice,” he reminded her. The tone of his voice still treacherously soothing. Taunting her with the truth.

His hand moved ever so slightly, and she tried bracing herself for the impact, but her body was overly sensitive at this stage already, and she sucked in a sharp breath when his fingers gently brushed her waist.

“You made yours when you got in the car tonight, didn't you?” he hummed, looking pleased as she trembled when he danced his fingers along her waist.

She looked up at him. Flushed. Nervous. Burning. Her answer a wisp. “I did.”

He studied her. Calm. Unmoved. But there was a heat simmering behind his glasses. And awe. Bottomless awe.

“Don't forget that,” he murmured. Softly. Relentlessly. His fingertips ghosted the hem of her shirt to where a small stripe of bare skin showed between it and her pants. His butterfly touch boiling liquid agony.

Her pulse quickened. Her breath reached the verge of racing. And yet, he hadn't even gotten started yet.

“Say it!” His voice was a deep rumble, reverberating through her womb, as his fingers drew a burning trail along that stripe of skin. “Say exactly what you need! And then tell me you will wait for it - as long as I want you to.” She swallowed hard. His relentless, ginger touch burned right through her skin. “I want to see how far your body will go to obey me before it gives in.”

Joanna was panting shallowly through slightly parted lips, her despair-drenched mind digging for the right words, but nothing could describe the desperate need raging inside her, trying to gnaw its way out.

“Say it!” he demanded again. Not impatiently - he had all the time in the world - but persistently.

And all the while, he kept drawing soft patterns across her belly with his fingertips, making it so hard for her to focus on anything other than his touch. Her need. The agony raging between her legs.

“I need to go so fucking badly,” she forced a whisper out between gritted teeth as the outspoken truth beared down so heavily between her thighs. “So badly that I don't care where or how,” she gritted out further, walking a tightrope between forcing words out of her body while trying so hard to keep everything else inside.

The hint of a pleased smile ghosted his lips again, his tender caress relentlessly adamant in its effort to break through her restraint.

“I believe that you don't care where.” A nasty sparkle flitted through his eyes as he grazed the dull side of his thumbnail over her skin, and a feeling like chalk on a whiteboard screeched through her, but no sound slipped past her lips.

“But I believe you do care how.” He still spoke with unnerving calm while she was shattering inside over and over just to piece herself together to make it through another moment. And another. And…

His lips curved more distinctly in a nasty way, and hot and cold shivers took turns running down her spine as he continued brushing his fingertips against her skin lightly like a feather's touch.

“It doesn't feel like true relief unless I give you permission to feel relief, does it?” he growled, his voice edged by raw desire and by the rush of power coursing through him. “That's why you're gonna wait, right?”

Joanna swallowed and nodded weakly, her answer barely audible. “Yes.”

“Say it!” he commanded, his tone not tolerating any form of objection.

She forced her jaws to relax just enough so that she could speak. “I'm gonna hold it until you give me your permission to get relief.”

The dark fire blazing up in his eyes overshadowed how pleased he looked, gazing down at her, his touch hovering above her bladder unwaveringly.

“Good,” he nodded, contentedly. “Now listen very carefully because I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna do to you.” Every word rolled from his tongue like honey. Dark. Sweet. Smooth. Suffocating. And oh so promising.

Wow, this is good stuff — you weren't kidding about being a passionate writer! 😶 I am eager to read part 2!

Thank you so much for the compliment! 😇 Yeah, no, I wasn't kidding indeed. Been honing my smut writing skills for more than 20 years by now, on and off, but I'm still not remotely where I wanna be 😅 Not having English as my native tongue makes it an extra challenge. But comments like yours make it so worthwhile ☺️ (apart from the shitload of fun I have WHILE writing 😁)

Soooo.... Here continues the torment 😇

Wishing you a nice (and desperate 😉) weekend!

###

Joanna held her breath as his touch ghosted the waistband of her jeans. No pressure. Just a reminder of how tight they strained over her belly.

She waited and listened - or at least, she tried to - while he took a moment - a long moment - to build up the suspense. To give her a foretaste of how he would savour dragging this out.

She almost crumbled under the mere prospect already, and he knew it. She could see it in his face that didn’t twitch. Deep satisfaction over her misery glowing behind a calm, controlled expression.

“First, I'm going to undress you,” he started after what felt like an eternity, and his touch slid along her hip as he slowly prowled around her. Like a predator circling its prey.

“Once you're naked, your body will scream to let go. You’ll be so tempted to give in to it. But I know you won't.” Every word melted on his tongue and dripped hot down her neck. Trickled down her spine. Pooled between her legs. One word, one drop at a time, eating away at her restraint.

He lowered his voice to an equally seductive and menacing almost-whisper. His breath brushing through her hair. Hers shaking when he slipped a finger in between her pants and shirt and set her lower back on fire with his touch.

“And I will watch you standing there. Naked. Squirming. So desperate and needy. So beautiful,” he breathed in awe while his hand slipped further under her shirt. Fingers ghosting her spine. His burning touch reaching deep into her. Causing her bladder to boil.

“Don't worry! I won't touch you. I'll only watch you squirm,” he hummed. As if that was any comfort. But Joanna could barely listen because his touch strayed further. His restless fingers slipped under her arm. Just briefly grazing through her armpit, but it tickled enough for her to dig her toes deeper into her shoes and clench every muscle in her body in her desperate attempt not to lose control.

“And when you feel like you can't wait any longer…” He was whispering now, leaning in from behind as he traced the outline of her breast with his fingertips, causing every tiniest hair on her body to stand on end. “…I'm gonna fuck you.”

Her heart skipped a beat. A twinge shot through her bladder. The first beads of sweat kissed her forehead.

Every muscle in her body tensed even further as she felt his teasing touch zooming in on her nipple, and she was afraid of what would happen when he reached it.

“I'm going to push my big, hard cock inside you,” he continued, growling huskily. “And you're going to feel so full that you will want to burst.”

The vivid image he painted for her burned and tingled between her legs. She could feel his every word as if he was inside of her already, and her breath caught once again before it hissed down her throat when he gently pinched her painfully taut nipple, and the ache between her thighs momentarily exploded.

A thunderstorm broke loose in her depths. Red-hot lightning surging through her sex like a live wire. Stinging and burning between her legs. For an agonizingly long moment, she didn't think she'd gonna make it. Not through this moment, let alone through his plans for her.

His lips almost brushed her ear as he leaned in further, whispering, “Breathe through it. I know you can do this.”

Joanna squeezed her eyes shut while he couldn't see it. She knew his words were meant to be soothing. Grounding. Encouraging. But with the pressure between her legs burning more unbearably by the second, they felt nothing but taunting to her, yet there was no strength left inside her to be angry with him. There was only desperation. All-consuming desperation. And the fear that she would lose the fight already while he kept rolling her stiff nipple between his fingers with bittersweet tenderness.

She didn’t. She fought through one moment at a time. Then the next. Every single fibre of her body, every single thought solely focused on holding in what she wanted to let go so badly.

“Breathe, Jo,” he kept whispering soothingly. Kept tormenting her nipple. Kept that live wire down to her bladder alive. “You can hold it because you know what's awaiting you if you do.”

More torment. More agony. More holding on by a thread. But that wasn't what he meant. Not only.

“Breathe,” he repeated, his voice itself barely above a breath, and his command slowly started melting into her. Started becoming a part of her as she tried to breathe through the electric jolts flashing from her nipple down into her womb.

“I know how much you want this, too,” he continued whispering to her. The hypnotic rhythm of his voice lulling her in. His warm hand slid across her stomach, down to her belly, and gently cupped over the feelable bulge. The warmth of his touch easing a bit of the tension despite the dangerous pressure.

“You long to feel me inside,” he murmured seductively. “And I long to feel how exquisitely tight you are. So full.”

He softly rubbed her belly. His warm, ginger touch was still agonizing, but also comforting. Safe. Grounding. And the feeling of losing it any second faded back to a dull, burning sensation of desperate need.

He was right. She could do this. She could hold it a little longer because she wanted this. There was nothing she craved more than overcoming herself to please him. And then...

Joanna nervously chewed on her bottom lip. Don't think about it yet! It'll only make this harder. Focus only on this moment. Enjoy it. Cherish it.

“And I will take my time.” His hand slowly slid further down her belly. Grazing over the front of her jeans. Ghosting the areas where it ached most. Teasing, but not touching.

“You love it when I go slow and gentle on you, don’t you?” His voice, again, was a deep, low rumble, feeling as if it was inside her now, not behind her anymore. “When I savour every moment that you feel so bursting full.”

Joanna held her breath, trying to will his hand to touch her where she ached so terribly by sheer mental power, but he wouldn't. Because he knew how badly she wanted it. How desperately she needed it.

He leaned in even closer, his lips tickling her neck as he spoke further. “I will make it so very hard for you to hold back while I fuck you so good,” he kept growling, his words threat and promise all at once, and her pulse twitched under his lips.

“Maybe, I will even allow you to come. If you want to.” Fuck, she wanted to come right here on the spot, but… “But you know that would make it even harder for you to keep holding because I won't be done with you then yet.”

She swallowed, hard, and her pussy throbbed once as his words alone were powerful enough to almost tip her over the edge.

“And you will want to keep holding it.” One wavering moment long, she wasn't so sure about that. “Because losing control and peeing on me while I'm still inside you would be just nasty, wouldn't it?” He chuckled mildly, adopting this belittling tone one would use to lecture a stupid child. She was neither. Neither stupid nor a child. But right there in this shabby motel room, she was his. And he made sure she wouldn't forget that.

He defined the rules of the world anew once again. What was nasty. What was allowed. When it was allowed. He made the rules, so she could get off on them.

“Wouldn't it?” he urged her to answer his question, which she had deemed a rhetorical one.

“Yes,” she breathed. Her voice thin as a wisp. Telling him what he wanted to hear while deep inside, the temptation of how good being nasty would feel swelled. Maybe even good enough not to care about what she’d miss out on if she folded prematurely.

“Good. I want you to remember that.” He straightened up, his hand, which had become part of her in the meantime, suddenly gone, and the cold it left behind sank its teeth into her belly.

He stepped in front of her again, urging her to look at him by slipping his fingers under her chin, so she had to look at the diabolically calm, pleased smile framing his lips. “I don't want you to get nasty before I tell you to. Or before I tell you how.”

A hot shudder weaved deep through her. She knew once he did, it would be oh so good. But first, she had to make it there. Even if she didn't know yet how.
