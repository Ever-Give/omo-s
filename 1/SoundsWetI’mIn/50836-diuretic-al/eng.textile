(Hey, i’m Alex! First, a little background on this story. This story is about my girlfriend, and myself giving her a diuretic to watch her squirm. My girlfriend and I collaborated in writing this - I have full permission from her to post this, though she doesn’t own an account on here. We share this fetish, and so we thought it would be fun to have a go at writing it. She planned out the story, explained how she would have felt, and I wrote it all into this story. Constructive criticism would be highly appreciated, as I am still learning. I hope you enjoy!)

(NOTE: Sutekina means lovely in Japanese. It’s a pet name I gave to her.)

It was 1:30 - just 5 minutes after her last lunch break. Hannah and her boyfriend, Alex, had been hanging out as per usual that break...

Alex’s messy, wind swept hair was hanging around his head as usual, the dark blond mesmerising her as she stared at him. Halfway through the break, Alex Challenged her to a chugging contest. He handed her a bottle of water, with his own already in his hand.

“You ready, Boo?” Alex smiled at her, but it wasn’t his usual smile. It seemed mischievous. Naturally, this worried Hannah. She wearily took the bottle, ready for Alex to play some sort of trick. Nothing happened, so she opened the bottle, and Alex followed suit.

“Ready.” Hannah smiled. Why was she worried? The only thing she needed to worry about was getting to a bathroom before the end of this break; she was starting to feel a little urge from her bladder.

“Three, Two, One, Go!”

The two chugged their bottles. Alex finished in around 8 seconds, Hannah in 10.

Alex raised a triumphant fist into the air, and cheered. “Sorry sutekina, but looks like I won.”

Hannah grinned at him. “Nice one, I’ve never been great at this.”

“Oh, speaking of not being great at stuff-“

“Oh no.”

“Be quiet, sutekina- anyway, as I was saying - there’s this tree I wanted to show you near the multicourts, it’s got really low branches - I bet we could climb it. It’s getting close to the end of break, do you wanna head down now?”

Of course, Hannah would love to go climb trees with her boyfriend. However, she did need a bathroom. Meh, I can hold it. She thought to herself. “Hell yeah!”

So off they went, talking about the comic-con that would be happening in a few weeks as they walked. When they got there, they were only a little while away from their next class at the library - which was convenient, because they’d taken most of break to get there. Just as they stopped at the side of the tree, the bell rang.

“Ah, dang. Let’s go to our stupid activity class, we can meet here first break tomorrow.”

Hannah nodded. Alex was always more talkative than her, she never needed to say much with him - he had enough words for the both of them. “Oh by the way... you know that water bottle you drank?” The grin appeared back on his face.

“What did you do to it, am I gonna die?” Hannah asked, rather alarmed.

“Nah, I just put a little something in it. Called a diuretic, look it up.” With a wink, he skipped off to class. Immediately, she whipped out her phone.

“What’s a diuretic?”

“Shit.”

So now it was just 5 minutes later, and Hannah was absolutely bursting. She wiggles in her seat, trying desperately to not hold her crotch. She kept seeing Alex look up at her, blushing, and obviously turned on. Hannah had known Alex was kinky, but she had no idea he was into... well... this. It was, admittedly, rather hot, though. She really couldn’t blame him. She tapped her feet aggressively, trying to focus on the monopoly game in front of her. She was playing with a freckled boy named Daniel, who she often played online games with alongside Alex, who was also playing.

“God fucking damn it Alex, I wanted that station.” Daniel said rather loudly, earning him a few glances from nearby students and a warning from the teacher. She shifted once again as a wave of desperation came over her. This would be a long, long session of board games.

50 minutes later

10 minutes left of class left - she could do this. She was now sitting towards the back of the room with Alex and Daniel. At this point, Hannah was squirming, and doing everything in her power to hold it in - apart from holding her crotch, that was. Daniel had no idea of what she was going through, and was occupied in a conversation with Alex about waterfalls. She wished she could tune it out, but they were talking so loudly.

“I just really like how the water cascades downwards. Y’know, like, pshhhhhhhh.” Daniel seemed to be remembering something from a long time ago as he said this.

“Oh, yes. You know, there’s a waterfall called the Hukou Waterfall that’s yellow, because of sediments. I’ve been there, it looks like piss. Imagine that, a piss waterfall, just hot, steaming pee flowing down a mountain, splashing softly as it hits the water.” Alex looked over at Hannah as he said this, who groaned. Daniel examined her position - crossed legs, biting lips, tapping fingers - and finally realised why Alex had brought up waterfalls.

“Oh. Hannah, do you have to-“

“Shut up Daniel, yes I have to fucking piss. We have 10 minutes of class left, and I’m probably gonna piss myself.” Clearly, Hannah saw no point in hiding her desperation anymore, and grabbed her crotch. “Fucking hell....”

Suddenly, Hannah felt a warmth near her crotch. “Ah- oh shit- I just leaked, I- I can’t hold much longer.”

Alex spluttered awkwardly - had he not expected her to get this desperate? She didn’t care right now. All she wanted was sweet release. Her bladder felt like a rock in her abdomen, growing bigger every passing minute. The conversation about waterfalls continued on, and Hannah began struggling immensely. With each second, another wave cam on, making her bite her lip and squirm restlessly. After what felt like an eternity, the bell rung. Hannah is free, or so she thought. At first, she hobbled out of the class, and made her way towards the bathrooms, when Alex grabbed her arm.

“Fuck- Alex please, I really have to pee.”

“I know. But you’re gonna hold it. Remember that tree? Follow me.”

They walked, and every step made Hannah come closer and closer to having an accident. She grabbed at her crotch every few steps, and moaned under her breath. When they got there, Alex led her to an odd form of branches. It seemed like a seat that would spread someone’s legs- shit.

“Sit, no questions.” Alex licked his lips.

Hannah was incredibly turned on, being told what to do by her dominant boyfriend. Although, her need to use the bathroom was overpowering her. When she sat down, her legs were forcibly spread by the branches. “Ooh, fuck. A-Alex, please-“ she could feel her control slipping with every second. She went to grab her crotch, but then her boyfriend said, “No hands.” Alex sat down opposite her and watched the show.

“Hhhholy fuck Alex- aah, fuck- please- please let me pee- I just- aaagh-“

“You May only pee when it forces its way out of you. You can do it, boo. You can hold it.”

“Holy shit, oh ffuuuuck, please Alex, please- Aaaah!- oooh, I gotta pee, I gotta pee so bad..”

She began leaking, slowly. Her stream started as a slow dribble, a wet spot on her pants starting to form. Slowly, a hissing noise filled the air, and hot pee flowed out of Hannah, as moans of bliss poured out of her mouth.

“Ooooh, fuck, it feels.... so... good. Aaaanh, oh Alex... mmmmmhh, oh- aaah...”

The wet spot was growing larger, and her pee trickled onto the grass. It must have gone on for at least a minute, and a large puddle of pee was surrounding her, still growing as she continued to wet. Slowly, Hannahs stream began to slow, and it came to a stop. Hannah was panting, and looked down at her mess.

“Fuck you, Alex, that was so hot...”
