It was just one of those days again,everything was far too loud and it was only first thing in the morning, Warriors and Legend were off to the side bickering about something related to some sort of rod it sounds like and Twilight was scolding Wild for yet another fire hazard made, and I can barely tell what everyone is saying, or well I can, it is just being particularly difficult it a blended mess.

Maybe we should start the day off some tea to help

Sounds like a plan, it might help everything quiet down

Red, get your fire rod we need to boil some water

Can't we just get Wild?

Ugh no he's being scolded for fire do you really think the others would even let him? Besides we have the tools and its just boiling water

Okay fair point, do we have our tea kettle?

Four just peaks into their bag at that, nodding to himself as he pull out the tea kettle and fire rod and goes to the pile of logs in the middle of the camp, setting a spark the pile as he fills the tea kettle all the way to the brim before moving to set it up over the growing small fire

______

Three cups in Four slowly looks around at the now settling down camp, looking over at Legend who walks over before deciding to ask if they want any considering they probably made too much, speaking with a small quirk of a smile "Oh hey Legend, do you want some tea? I've made plenty...and it would be a waste"

Legend slowly glances rolling his eyes before turning back around "No I'm good, I had some carrot juice and that satisfied me enough" the answer of which only serving to make Four curious as he ignores the eye roll

"Where...where did you get some carrot juice?"

"None of your business"

Well maybe there is a store with juice in it in that last town we were at previously I guess an interesting choice though

Hey let's ask Time instead- he's near as well

"Ah hey Time, would you like some tea?"

Time slowly smiles, shaking his head as he waves off the offer and resumes packing up his things "No thanks, I don't really like tea, I appreciate the offer though"

"Oh, Wind?"

"Isn't that for relaxing? I'm good! I don't need to relax" Wind answers with a quick bounce of his feet, having already finished putting away all of his things, and Legend huffs towards as he puts his shield over his back

"You could tone it down a bit though"

"You are just jealous of my boundless amounts of energy Vet"

Dammit we made too much and no one wants any-

Well...we should have asked everyone before making as much as we did

What are we going to do with the extra tea?

Drink it ourselves? How much is left?

More than half the kettle I'd say

Well… maybe that would be good? More tea just means that the day will go by smoother! We will be able to enjoy doing everything with everyone and not have to worry!

We should probably hurry then, I think everyone is starting to pack up camp

With no further discussion Four just gave a small shrug, quickly pouring more tea into his cup as he finishes the kettle himself after several more cups, barely finishing in time before Time said that it was time get going, standing up before frowning a little bit in noticing that he might need to stop for a leak soon at the sudden tingling feeling that hits his nether regions upon getting to his feet

Shit maybe that much tea was a bad idea after all

Did we even go to the bathroom yet this morning?

Fuck. no we didn't, it was too damn loud

Well, we can't ask to stop or wander off now we only just started walking but I'm sure we will be fine we can wait, it's not like we haven't had to wait before we aren't a small child

Besides, if we started asking to stop for this already this soon I'm sure it would only give Warriors more leeway aside from our height to treat us like we are one. Don't want that

Four slowly sighs to himself quietly opting to distract himself as they walk up to Hyrule within the middle of the group, starting up a talk with asking questions on how they feel about Legend's Hyrule and answering their own opinions as well back in return, after a good while Warriors gradually walking over with a smug expression to put in his own opinions, plenty of them being rather positive but still poking some fun in whenever.

Legend looked over, as more than an hour gradually passed throughout the conversation as Four grew restless and his breath grows heavier as the liquid gradually filled up down into his bladder more and more within the entire pass hour, his feet tapping on the ground every moment they pause as his breath hitches near silently with every moment they have to step over something as he slowly sweats and looks around behind at the forest they just left and head out into a open field, before jolting and letting out a breath of relief internally in luck how that didn't make him leak as Warriors taps them on the shoulder

"What's got our little smithy so distracted?"

"Just...just thinking about mn about things"

The response only makes the Captain curious, responding with a smirk as he ruffles the hair on Four's head

"Oooh? Care to tell us what's going on in that head of yours?"

Maybe we should ask if we can turn back around in the the trees real quick to take a leak

Ughhhh don't say that word

It hasn't been that long though since we left camp...and the Captain or someone else maybe even would probably tease us if we asked to stop this soon

I hate how you are right-

But we need to, it's getting really distracting and it's getting really hard to stand normally and keep our legs apart at a normal width

Want, not need, we can wait the field probably isn't that large

Let's at least try to wait until someone else asks to stop, it would be awkward to ask now

Uhm...guys I think we- are we-?

Four slowly fidgets and tenses a little bit,covering his mouth with one hand as his legs tense up together as he notices a barely noticeable tent under his tunic, his face slowly reddening as he crosses his arms to keep them from gravitating to holding himself as Warriors continues to try to talk to him, not that he's noticing as colors flicker in his eyes

Did we really get hard over this?

Might just be hormones, or the pressure on our lower regions caused it

We... are feeling kinda hot and bothered though aren't we, it might be more than that

"Four? Four, Four, Four!"

Four quickly snaps his head startledly towards Warriors, noticing how heavy his own breathing is right now as Four subconsciously pulls on the bottom of his tunic as Warriors simply raises a eyebrow

"Huh-- what? Sorry I wasn't listening"

"I can see that, Twilight asked you a question, rainbow eyes"

"O..oh...what is it?"

Twilight simply smiles a little bit, as if to say it's alright that it took them awhile to respond

"What was that staff you used yesterday, the one that flipped that basket of fruit right-side up again in town"

"Oh thats…. that is the cane of pacci-"

"How did it do that?"

"It...is just something I found when I was a kid, it was...mainly used to flip over pots which...doesn't sound like much but it came in handy quite a few times and-"

Four quickly gets cut off from a shout, Wild looking over at everyone with a sword already drawn

"Monsters ahead!!"

Four quickly looks up startledly, tensing up in place as he slowly squeezes his arms with his hands before he shakes his head and reaches up for his sword as his hand shakes before moving to run up to catch up to the others that have already started fighting the monsters, huffing as if out of breath as he dashes and swings the four sword to hit a moblin only to gasp as the movement causes a spurt and a damp feeling in his underwear as he freezes up while a powerful wave of desperation crashes over him, giving the enemy a chance to strike back as he briefly hears a teammates cry of panic, managing to barely dodge with nothing more than a slice of a scratch over his leg as he swings his sword up to finish off the moblin as everyone finishes off the patch of monsters before rushing over to Four, who trembles in effort to hold in the overflowing amount of liquid in his small body, struggling to answer as blood trickles down his leg as Time puts a hand on Four's shoulder

"Are you alright Four?"

"You just freezed up there are you alright?"

"Nn...ah I'm...f….fine, I'm fine"

"You don't sound too fine"

Sky gently moves to have Four sit down against a rock in the field that happens to be there, calling Hyrule over to help before Warriors lifts up Four's leg to inspect the wound as Four internally panics as his bladder spasms in his legs being spread apart in such a way, feeling urine leak from the slit of his manhood as wet blooming warmth spreads across crotch and bottom, slowly dampening his leggings as he suddenly grows grateful that they are black as he desperately tries to will his bladder to cut off the flow as he clamps down the lower regions muscles. Barely noticing the bleeding gash on his leg being healed as his legs tremble in his efforts, squeezing his legs together the second he feels his leg being put back down on the ground.

"Are you overheating there smithy? Your face is kinda red...do you need any water?"

Four barely resists the urge to start squirming then and there as he clutches the brim of his tunic tightly as his legs tremble and slowly squeeze against his slightly aching manhood lightly in a effort to keep himself from leaking more, looking up Sky who gives Four a rather concerned expression

"I…I'm fine, a little...worn out, but fine please don't worry"

"Alright if you say so…"

Sky slowly offers Four a hand back up which Four slowly accepts and slowly stands up to which he quickly regrets while suppressing a groan as he feels the smallest of leaks escape as a warm trickle goes down the right side of his inner thigh. Glancing at the beads of liquid dripping off the blades of grass right where he was previously sitting nervously as he desperately stops anymore from leaking out as he feels Warriors hand go onto the middle of his back

"Ready to go?"

We are about to oh goddesses we are about to- whether we are ready or not-

I don't think they mean that kind of go-

Guys, I'm second guessing my previous statement I don't know how much longer we will be able to hold the rest of this, however much it is still in us anyways

Four slowly looks ahead more panickingly, his body shaking with every step as he barely resists having his breath hitch when he feels Warriors lightly push on his back to help him move forward, looking down at his feet and tries to hyper focus on every single step as he clutches onto the bottom of his tunic tightly and keeps his legs close together with every step, feeling as though eyes are on him from all around as he feels his breath come out in hot puffs.

The urine soaked into the crotch and bottom of his leggings slowly cooling against the air but not faltering in dampness as he shakingly and slowly brings his hand up to feel his bladder, gritting his teeth together tensely when he feels how round, solid, and full it still is as if some of what was in his bladder previously wasn't clinging to the fabric of his tights when a another wave of desperation hits him almost painfully as his mouth shuts in a fine line and he tries to freeze in place only for Warriors to frown behind him as they just barely push on Four's back to encourage him to keep moving

"Four? Do you need to take a break?"

Four hears the question from Warriors but doesn't know if he can answer, feeling like he will moan in the desperate urge to release the liquid in his body into a large puddle on the ground, hissing under his breath when he feels a small spot of warmth against the cold wetness at those betraying thoughts.

Wait no goddess no don't think about that that's bad to think about

Wait are we being picked up-

Four quickly snaps his eyes back open, when did they close- looking down panickingly when they see the ground much farther down than before as their legs are slowly spread and held onto by a pair of hands, gasping as feels his stomach get pressed against another person as his eyes slowly water as his full bladder presses against the person's solid back while he clutches on noticing a deep royal blue fabric- before he looks up frantically at the dramatically blond locks of hair in seeing that it is Warriors, before quickly burying his face into their scarf muffling a moan as he desperately holds on

"You wouldn't answer so I took it upon myself to help you, just take it easy little guy"

Take it easy? Take it easy? Now its even harder to hold-!

I can feel our nether regions grinding against their tailbone oh goddesses do you think they can feel that we are hard, why are we hard again-

I think that maybe we actually-

Why are you worrying about that when we are moments away from peeing on mr pretty boy!?

Please, please don't say that right now, can we speak and tell Wars to put us down-

No, I don't think we can. I feel like if we try to talk now we will end up making it obvious with how we will sound- ah!

Four quickly muffles a small groan against the scarf, his body squirming up slightly as he trembles in effort all over as a low hissing sound fills their ears and what little amount of their leggings has dried becomes wet with warmth as he gasps and holds on tightly to Warriors, who of which looks behind at Four confused as the back of Warrior's tunic starts to become faintly damp, though not enough for Warriors to notice as Four's body slowly trembles more in all his effort to stop the flow as he he tenses up his muscles in his body, a small faint whimper escaping from his mouth in the process, before his ears twitch as he picks up on Warriors voice, of which is sounding genuinely concerned.

"Hey, Four? Do you need to be checked again? Do you have any other injuries? We are reaching another forest soon so we will be able rest soon if you need it"

"That...sounds good, but...don't worry I'm I'm alright...nnnh"

"...You sure don't sound like you are fine"

Four chooses not to comment on that, glancing towards the forest that both looks so close yet so far away at the same time, his body tense as he squirms against Warriors back slowly and clings on tighter to them, moving to bury his face into the scarf again as he feels the pressure grow more heavy, his bladder feeling like an intense leaking weight in his body as he muffles several sounds into the scarf slowly as his breath becomes just a little bit heavier, time slowly passing before he feels himself shaked lightly on the shoulder by a hand from behind glancing back to see a head of pink hair in his vision, it being Legend of which of course slowly glancing down Warrior's back and at Four's leggings noticing the darkening dampness of the clothing as Legend's mouth goes into a fine line in alarm while clearly debating if he should say something and on how he should say it.

"We have reached the forest now, thought I would let you know since your face seemed smothered there in the lump of blue"

Legend seems to frown a little bit more at that, his eyes narrowing slightly as he glances at Warrior's before back at Four as he leans in to whisper into Four's ear quietly as he can.

"And you might want to ask him to carry you deeper into the forest, just say that it needs to be in private, I will handle things here"

Four slowly nods his head at that as his face reddens slowly in embarrassment before Legend walks ahead of them, before Four takes a shuddering breath and tugs on Warrior's scarf lightly to get their attention, his body slowly shaking more in both anticipation and desperation as he fights with himself internally on how he should say it.

"Gotta...W...Wars- forest- n-need to...personal, take me…..please-"

"Sure…?"

At that point everything seems to muffle, sounds and sights alike as Warriors takes them deeper into the forest after informing everyone they will be right back. Seconds feeling like minutes, and minutes feeling like hours as Four gradually clutches on tighter and tighter at the thought of relief.

Almost there, almost there, we will be able to let go any second now

Hahhh It's like a mini lake is inside of us

Actually...I think that would be worse but goddesses I'm sure it will look like it-

Yeah I can almost feel it now- ...wait

Four's body quickly tenses back up again as his face turns more red than before, noticing that he had started relax the muscles too soon but it being too late as the dam breaks and an alarmingly noticeable moan slips out of him mouth as warm urine gushes out of his tired bladder, pooling down his already mostly wet leggings and thoroughly soaking the back of Warrior's tunic and down into their own pants as well a little bit within seconds as Warrior's quickly looks back in utter surprise as their eyes go wide, quickly taking Four off of his back and setting them down.

Four quickly leaning his back against a tree as he slumps and lets out another moan in relief, his eyes lidding in a daze as liquid almost starts to flood his boots before Warriors quickly pulls down Four's leggings and underwear for them, his dampened penis going right up upon being freed from his soaked clothing as urine finally pools from his urethra right onto the grass between him and Warriors who of which hold his shoulders to prevent them from falling over, being in a trance of relief as the puddle slowly grows, the ground being unable to soak it all into the dirt as fast as it comes out, sighing blissfully before Four's eyes snap back open wide as his entire face turns the most vibrant shade of red yet in realization as he slowly and hesitantly looks up at Warriors, who just stares down at Four's lower half as it slowly trickles to a stop as the last of it drips out, while he reaches to feel the wetness on his own back.

"Holy Hylia, why didn't you say anything sooner?? Goddesses smithy- how much do you have in you? Didn't think your tiny body could poor this much out of it...shit we can't go back to the chain like this"

"I uh…look- it was- I-"

Warriors just sighs a little bit, slowly shaking his head before speaking again before Four tries to continue to explain themselves.

"Well...I guess it happens, seen it before happen to soldiers on the battlefield after long days with with plenty of hydration, it can happen to anyone so-"

Warriors slowly pauses a little bit as he looks to the side as if he noticed something before he suddenly picks up Four like a sack of potatoes with their face facing Warrior's back as their legs dangle from the front, who of which yelps in alarm having not even pulled up his leggings and underwear back up as they hang around his knees loosely as Warriors suddenly walks in another direction before he suddenly full on yeets Four straight into a lake that he had spotted in the forest with a splash, before jumping straight into the lake himself just as Four sputters out water while bringing his back up to the surface before reaching into the water to pull up his leggings as Warriors smirks in Four's direction.

"There problem solved"

"A little warning would have been nice!?"

"Well I didn't get much more of a warning before you peed on me besides the moan you made I almost thought you were masterbating on me for a split second there, so I'd say we are even"

Warriors just slowly smirk more as he says that, before moving up to Four and messing up their hair teasingly as he slowly grins and asks a question that makes the small hero squawk and blush crimson as they swat at the other while Warriors quickly starts laughing at the offended reaction

"Actually do you moan like that when you ride on your significant other~?"

"What the hell Wars-!?!"

After several more rounds of laughter, they soon enough splash at each other in the lake as of which gradually turned it a bout of some sort of playfight of trying to dunk the other in the water, Four practically climbing onto Warriors at points to do so until they eventually climb out of Lake, dripping head to toe with water and looking like a couple of drenched rats as they head back to the rest of the chain, where everyone looks at them alarm, some concerned, others utterly amused or even laughing, Time himself looking over with an amused smirk of his own as Warrior's tries to wring out the water from his scarf

"What happened to you two? Fall into a lake or something?"

"Actually yes, quite literally, tripped over a rock and fell straight in"

Laughter only fills throughout the entire group at that point before they all start moving again after taking a moment to calm down, occasionally teasing their two wet teammates all the way until they become dry again, Four smiling a little bit in seeing that it doesn't look like anyone besides Warrior's and Legend knows what had occurred as they finally walk quite normally with everyone else, feeling more light than ever as their shoulders slump until they glance at the ground and notice their shadow seemingly smirking with almost a gleam to their eyes from below the small hero.

Well fuck.
