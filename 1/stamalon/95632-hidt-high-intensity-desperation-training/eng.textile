H.I.D.T – Part 6

Sophie’s legs could barely separate from one another as Sophie power walked as fast as she could towards the bathrooms. She held both hands to her sides, clinching them to fists. It was really difficult to walk in her situation. Her bladder screamed at her, threatening to let go at any moment. Sophie contracted her pelvic muscles as tight as possible, but she was still on the verge of wetting herself.

The gym was so crowded in the afternoon. All of those women, training and walking around. Drinking water. Ooohhh! No! She has to focus. She will not lose this battle again. But then, she arrived to the bathroom, or it’s more accurate to say, the line to the bathroom.

OH! F*CK! NO NO NO! I WON’T MAKE IT.

Sophie stood there, staring at the line to the bathroom, holding her crotch with both hands and double crossing her legs. She bent forward and wiggled her butt from side to side. There were at least four women in line OUTSIDE the bathrooms’ door. Who knows how many are inside! She doesn’t have time for this. She couldn’t stop moving and squirming, moaning in desperation the whole time. Women walked by and stared at her, but she didn’t care. She doesn’t feel embarrassed anymore. Well… Not in this situation. If she would pee herself, that’s another story.

Sophie held her place for a few more seconds and considered her options. She could ask to cut in line. No. she doesn’t want to talk to strangers in this situation. And it isn’t sure they will agree. Maybe go to the showers? Again, a lot of women and not guaranteed. Only one more option, and she didn’t know how to feel about it.

Sophie turned around and zig zagged towards the office. She knocked on the entrance door and shoved the hand immediately back between her legs. She hoped that he is there.

“One moment, please.” Peter’s voice was a blessing for her ears.

The door had been opened and Peter stood on the other side. He smiled at first and looked like he wants to greet her, but his eye opened wide and his jaw fell to the ground as he saw Sophie’s position. She was bent over and double crossed, bouncing in place. Her hands were between her legs, and she gasped and moaned desperately. She looked at him and knew she didn’t even need to explain.

“Help… oh… emm… ME…” she begged with eyes filled with tears.

“Can you walk?” he asked in a serious tone.

She nodded her head slowly, trying not to lose focus. Her bladder hurting like never before. Her urethra burning and crying for relief. She couldn’t even think straight. It became torturous. Peter closed the office door behind him and went to the staff bathroom. Sophie followed him slowly, holding herself as tight as possible. Her muscles were about ready to give up.

“You can come in.” Peter said, holding the bathroom door wide open.

Sophie took a deep breath and moaned again, as she clenched her muscles for the last few steps. She got in and the door closed behind her. Now she is finally in front of the toilet. She can finally get the relief she wants so much. But first, she needed to take her bodysuit off. Her bladder didn’t like the idea of waiting so close to the toilet and sent a spasm of pain down her stomach. Sophie bent over and double crossed her legs again. She can’t move. But she is so close! She reached behind her neck with one hand, while the over holds her crotch tight. She could reach the zipper but could not open it. Every time she pulled, the fabric just bent and folded into itself. The zipper didn’t move. Desperate, she reached quickly with the over hand and tried to hold the fabric in place. An awful mistake, as a second hasn’t passed and her urethra gave up for the first time. Without the hand holding her crotch, a spurt came out.

“OH! SH*T!” she cried and shoved both hands again between her legs.

She successfully stopped the spurt, but she could feel it. Her crotch was wet. She looked down and saw the stain, visibly turning the light green fabric to dark green. The pain from her bladder got much greater and the pressure was enormous. She couldn’t let go, or she would risk another spurt. What would she do?

“Sophie?” Peter’s voice came from behind the door “Are you ok?”

His question surprised Sophie and made her lose focus for a moment. Another spurt, longer this time, escaped and the pee ran down her inner thigh. she was completely at lost right now. she has no other choice.

"P… Peter?” she mumbled.

“What’s wrong? You don’t sound so good.” Peter said worriedly.

“C… Can you… oh… UH! Co… Come… in?”

“You… You want me to come in?” Peter repeated the question, naturally surprised.

“oh… Y… ah… Yeah.” Sophie could barely speak at this point.

“OK.” Peter opened the door and was shocked “What? What happened?!”

“Help… pl… oh… PLEASE!” Sophie begged him again, while looking through her shoulder with tears in her eyes, her butt squirming in front of him.

“You… You sure?” Peter hesitated “If I understand you correctly, you want me to… open the zipper.”

“YES! QUICKLY!” she yelled and bent into herself as another short spurt came out. She is losing control!

Peter closed the door behind him and got closer. Sophie did everything to hold her pee for just a little longer. She squirmed, crossed her legs, held her crotch with her hands, bent over. Everything just not losing control in front of Peter! Peter grabbed her collar and zipped her bodysuit down. He did it slowly and carefully at first, but then the zipper got stuck at her hair and pulled Sophie’s head back. The sudden pull and pain caused another spurt to escape.

“AHH! Uhhh…” Sophie moaned and bent even further forwards.

Her butt touched Peter’s crotch for a split second, but Sophie could feel his hard ‘thing’ against her soft and wet crotch. Peter moved away, like an instinct, but Sophie pressed her crotch against his again.

“I… need you… It’s… ah… leaking… oh…” she said softly and pressed her crotch even harder.

She could feel it twitching and growing even bigger. His hips pressed back against her butt. Her legs were still moving and squirming around, but his crotch followed her in every direction, rubbing against her wet pussy. She was so horny and SO desperate, she couldn’t even think straight. Peter grabbed the zipper again and carefully pulled her hair out before opening the zipper all the way to her waist.

“You can take it off now.” Peter moved away and reached to the door “I will just go…”

“WAIT!” Sophie pressed her butt forcefully against him again “I… Uh! I can’t… oh… oohh…”

She couldn’t move. She couldn’t let go of her crotch or take a step. She was about to pee herself, and right in front of the toilet.

“What do you mean you can’t?” Peter sounded confused and worried.

“Help… ah… me…”

“How?”

“DO SOMETHING! PLEASE! OOOHHHH…” called Sophie and another spurt escaped, this one was almost impossible to stop “I AM LEAKING!”

Peter grabbed her by the shoulder and turned her around quickly. This made her straighten up, losing the grip of her crotch and the contact with Peter. All of that just broke her hold and the stream gushed out like a fire hose. This surprised and scared Sophie, so she did the only thing that she could think of and hugged Peter tight, his muscular leg between hers. She pressed her pussy against him, trying desperately to hold the stream, but it was too late. The pee kept rushing out and splashed on the floor.

“I am sorry… I am so sorry…” cried Sophie as she can’t ignore the orgasmic sensation that went thorough her whole body like electricity.

Her bodysuit and her shoes were now completely soaked, as Peter’s shorts were too, but the stream didn’t stop. She looked up at Peter without letting go, tears in her eyes, not even sure if it was because she was so humiliated or because she just felt SO good at the moment. She expected an expression of disgust or loathing, but she was surprised to see his face, full of shock and a little excitement. Sophie just couldn’t hold herself back anymore. She reached up with her head and kissed him, still peeing in full force. Peter didn’t fold back, but instead kissed her passionately back. They kissed and held each other as the stream slowly got weaker. As the stream finally stopped, Sophie pulled her head away and looked down in realization. Both her legs and Peter’s leg were completely wet, and the floor was flooded with pee.

“I… I am so sor…” Sophie was about to cry again.

“Shut up.” Said Peter with a smile and kissed her again.

Sophie kissed him back, her hand moving along his broad shoulders and muscular back. She dug her fingernails into his back and felt how his hand was feeling her back. She traveled down to his round ass and hard-as-stone thighs, and then Peter did the same. She climbed back up, slowly going under his shirt and stroking his bare skin. Peter grabbed her open bodysuit and forcefully pulled it down, exposing her bare tits and her stomach. He fumbled her right tit and dug his other hand under the bodysuit, grabbing one of her butt cheeks and squeezing it, all while still kissing her intensively. Sophie moaned in pleasure.

She moved her pussy against his leg, letting the wet fabric dig even deeper and the sensation get even more intense. She never felt so good in her life, but she wants more. She pulled his pants with one hand, reviling his big, hard and standing upwards penis. She held it in her hand, feeling Peter’s pulse and the twitching to her touch. She stroked it up and down lightly, just wanting to squeeze it as hard as she can. Peter moaned and got even more aggressive. He kissed her neck and bit into it, almost ripping a piece of her skin. Sophie wanted to scream out of pleasure, but she held back, letting only stifled moans out of her mouth. He became a beast, and she loved it. She wanted it so badly. She wanted him SO badly!

“I am really sorry to interrupt you, guys. But I really need to get inside.” Lora’s voice was coming from the other side of the door with a few strong nocks.

Sophie and Peter froze in place. They moved away from one another, terrified of the fact that Lora probably heard everything. They held each other for a few more seconds, waiting for nothing in particular.

“Guys!” another nock on the door “Seriously, I need to get IN!”

“Sorry, Lora. We will be right out.” Called Peter with a frustrated look in his eyes.

He let go of Sophie and took a step back, quickly pulling his pants back on. Sophie didn’t want to stop, but she understood very well that her needs would have to wait for another time. She, too, pulled the Bodysuit back up and on. She didn’t even closed the zipper.

“Ready?” asked Peter.

Sophie nodded. Peter opened the door. Lora stood there with one hand between her legs and a smog smile on her face.

“You two are just so adorable when you are blushed.” She said while shifting from side to side.

“I am sorry, Lora. There was a bit of an… accident inside.” Said Peter, couldn’t even look at her “I wil clean it up, I promise!”

“And I will clean your suit and bring it back to you.” Said Sophie, feeling so humiliated.

“I don’t care right now. You can keep the suit.” Lora pushed them aside “Just let me in.”

Lora got into the bathroom and locked the door behind her. Sophie and peter stayed outside of the bathroom wet, horny and smelling like pee. Sophie didn’t know what to say. It was so awkward. Why does it have to be so awkward?!

“So… Do you have a towel to shower?” asked Peter, embarrassed.

“Yeah.”

“Good. And a soap?”

“Yes.”

“Great.”

Again, silence. This damn silence. Why? Sophie just wanted to burry herself out of embarrassment.

“I will go now…” said Sophie sheepishly.

Sophie turned away, but to her surprise, Peter caught her wrist.

“I don’t think it’s disgusting!” he called “I actually found it really sexy.”

“You mean…”

“You, peeing yourself. This is really hot.”

“Well, thanks. But…”

“And I really like you. Would you go out with me?”

Sophie was shocked. It felt like a line out of a cheep Rom-com. She wanted to laugh, and cry, and just scream out of embarrassment. But instead, she just looked at Peter with her eyes wide open. Peter was blushing, probably out of embarrassment too. It’s a dream, right? It feels like it.

“Emm… I…” Sophie mumbled.

“You don’t have to!” said Peter, panic on his face.

“I would.” Said Sophie “I would… love to.”

H.I.D.T – Part 7

It is finally here! A month of trainings and a lot of self-development (and self-discovery), the day of the first H.I.D.T is here. Sophie could barely sleep at night from excitement. Her whole body was tingly and fidgety. So happy and so nervous. For the first time, she would have to stand before the class. Well, not alone. Lora will be there. But still! It is a lot of responsibility.

As she arrived at the gym, half an hour before the training, the women were already outside the training rooms, gathered together in a group and drinking the energy drink that Lora always gives her. So many shapes and forms of women, some looked even like actual Victoria Secret models. All of those women are beautiful. All of them were wearing tight and short clothes that didn’t leave much for the imagination.

“Hey! Sophie! So good to see you!” Vicki called her from the group and ran towards her with a big smile on her face and the drink in her hand “Have you tried this drink already? It is so delicious!”

“I know Vicki.” Sophie felt a bit awkward from Vicki’s enthusiasm “I gave you to drink it when we first met, remember?”

“Really? I didn’t remember that.” Vicki took another sip “The trainer said that we all need to sign this disclaimer and drink one bottle of those drinks. I really want to take another one. Do you think I am allowed to?”

“I can’t see why not.”

“I will take you there!” Vicki grabbed her hand “You can take one too. And you need to sign before the training starts.”

“I actually signed already.” Sophie slipped her hand out of Vicki’s grip “And I am sorry, but I need to go and change before I meet with the trainer.”

“Oh, right. I forgot.” Vicki said embarrassed “You are the trainer’s assistant. Sorry.”

“You don’t have to apologize.” Sophie comforted her “I will see you inside.”

“Ok!”

Vicki ran back to the group, her breast giggled to the sides under her big and loose T shirt with every step. Sophie was amazed by her energies. She was so young and still so beautiful.

Sophie went to the changing room. She put her bag down and took out her clothes for today: a red tank top, a black spandex, white sports bra and sports shoes. As Sophie took off her clothes, another woman came in and immediately caught her attention. The woman was tall and tanned, walking confidently like a swan. She was wearing a short, black crop top and miniskirt. Her stomach was flat and her legs were perfect with a tattoo of a rose on her thigh. Her long brown hair was waving behind her, as she opened the locker beside Sophie and started to undress. Sophie didn’t even realize that she was staring, until the gorgeous woman made an eye contact with her. Sophie just looked away and kept dressing up, embarrassed that this hot woman caught her staring.

“You don’t have to be shy. We are all women here.” Said the woman in a sedative and smooth voice.

“I… I didn’t mean to stare. I am sorry.”

“Nonsense!” the woman laughed “I find it as a compliment if even a woman stare at me like that. It’s impowering.”

Sophie just smiled sheepishly. She felt so awful for her behavior.

“So, are you also here for the new high intensity training?” the woman asked.

“Emm… Yeah. I am the trainer’s assistant.”

“So you are Sophie!” called the woman “Lora was talking about you nonstop. You can really do a good first impression, aren’t you?”

“You know Lora?” Sophie was surprised.

“You can say we are friends since forever. She told me about the course, and I said that of course I will come and support her. She knows I have a bit of a problem at trainings, but she promised me that this course is for me. I mean, if a great trainer like Lora says something like that, I will absolutely try it!”

“Problem?” Sophie was curious.

“You wanna know, huh?” the woman said teasingly.

“No! I mean… You don’t have to tell me if you don’t want to. I just… well…”

“It’s fine, sweety! You didn’t cross any boundaries. I am not mad.”

Sophie just felt so awkward and embarrassed during this conversation. Why do people like her make her so uncomfortable?

“My name is Hanna by the way.” Said the woman “I think it is fair that you would know, considering the fact that I know your name already.”

“Nice to meet you. I am Sophie.”

“I know, sweety.”

At this point Sophie just wanted to die from embarrassment.

Hanna closed the locker and put her big towel on her shoulder. She was wearing a black sports bra and black shorts. If Sophie had a body like hers, she would also dress like that every day. Hanna winked at her and smiled.

“I will see you at training.” She said as she left the changing room.

Sophie felt so relieved, but at the same time even more nervous than before. All of this emotional rollercoaster left her whole body tense. She needs to calm down. Then she felt another tension in her bladder. And spasm that hinted the urge to pee. Sophie looked at the door, leading to the bathrooms. The thought crossed her mind. ‘If I go now, I will be able to perform much better during the training, right?’ Wait… No! the whole idea is desperation. She can’t go now to the bathroom and do the training with everyone else with a clean conscience.

Sophie took a deep breath, grabbed her towel and bottle of water and went out of the changing room. She went straight to the office to meet Lora, looking straight with confident and avoiding the crowd outside the training room. She could although see out of the corner of her eye some women, who started already dance around or wriggle their behinds.

As Sophie reached the office, she saw Lora coming out with three bottles between her arms. One was a water bottle, and the two others were the energy drinks, one of them half empty, probably hers.

“Oh! Sophie! You are here.” Lora handed her the bottle “Drink up! We are starting soon.”

Lora sounded so excited, but also distracted. She didn’t even look in Sophie’s eyes. She closed and locked the office door behind her. That just made Sophie more nervous.

“Is everything OK, Lora?” Sophie asked while drinking the energy drink.

“Yeah, it’s all good. I am just alone here today. I had a lot to do until now. But don’t worry about it. You need to stay focused. And drink up! It is almost time.”

“You really like this drink, if you promote it so badly to the others too.” Sophie laughed and drank the whole bottle in one go.

“What? No. That’s not the reason.” Said Lora, a bit confused “The energy drink have high levels of diuretics inside. One bottle can make a woman desperate in less then 10 minutes. Perfect for our training.”

“WHAT?!” Sophie was shocked “Why didn’t you tell me before?”

“Everything is written in the disclaimer I gave you and everyone else to sign. Didn’t you read it? It also says that you are not allowed, for medical reasons, to drink more than one bottle a week. You drank one two days ago, so make sure you drink a lot of water today, got it?”

Oh no… Vicki…

“Emm… I believe one of the girls drank more than one bottle already.”

“What? How do you know that? Who is it?” Lora sounded a bit angry.

“It’s Vicki, the little one with the big t shirt.” Sophie pointed at the women “She told me she wants a second one, and I didn’t know that the drinks are so dangerous. I am so sorry! I will tell her and apologize to…”

“Sophie, stop!” Lora grabbed her arms and looked her in the eyes “You are panicking for nothing. Don’t tell her anything. It will just make her scared and anxious too. The drinks are not poisonous, but it will be hard for her in the next couple of hours, until the diuretics will get out of her system. The best thing you can do is be there for her and make sure she drinks a lot of water, despite the constant urge to pee. Got it?”

“I… I think so…”

“Good.” Lora let go of her and smiled “Now put a smile on your face and let the show begin!”

For the next few minutes Sophie just followed Lora as she greeted everyone and opened the door to the training room. All the women came in, some dancing around, some already holding themselves. Sophie’s mind spiraled out of control. She felt so guilty and nervous. She looked for Vicki with her eyes between the crowd. Vicki looked really happy and excited. Yes, she danced around and fidgeted, but a lot of women did the same. It took some of her stress off her. maybe it’s really not as bad as she imagined. She needs to calm down again. This is just a training. Lora was right. She needs to smile and make it a good experience for every woman here.

“Take your places, everyone!” called Lora “make sure you have enough space around you.”

All the women spread out in the room, facing towards Lora. Sophie stood beside Lora and looked around at the squirming women. Hanna stood in the first row, right in front of Sophie, putting her towel underneath her and standing straight. She looked composure, although her thighs were pressed against one another. She looked at Sophie and smiled, like she was planning something, or just teasing her again. Vicki stood behind Hanna, almost all the way in the end. She still looked happy, although she couldn’t stop dancing from foot to foot and bouncing. Her breast bounced with her, making it hard not to stare at her.

“Welcome to the first training of High Intensity Desperation Training, or H.I.D.T for short.” Lora announced proudly “During those trainings, as you know, we will work on every muscle group, especially the leg, while desperate to pee. The last part is the most critical one. We want the bladder to be full in order to gain the maximum level of intensity at the bally und pelvic floor area. If the urge is too much to bear, there are towels in the corner. I would ask all of you not to leave the room for the duration of this training, so the session would not be cut short and damage the experience of the others here. Now let’s start the training!”

Cheers and applause filled the room. Everyone was excited to start. Even Sophie was frilled. She forgot for a moment all the tension and stress, and just wanted to have fun. Her bladder sent another spasm, made Sophie squeeze her legs together. She is also becoming desperate.

“We will start with running in place.” Instructed Lora “Knees up and arms move with every step.”

All the women including Sophie and Lora started running in place. Between the stepping sounds, Sophie heard some moaning and sighing, probably out of desperation. And then she heard a sound that she didn’t expect to hear yet. A short spurt of pee. She scanned quickly the crotches of the whole group when she heard it again. This time she detected the source. Hanna’s black shorts glistened with pee, as a few drops dripped down her leg and onto the towel. Hanna stopped running for a moment and crossed her legs, trying to stop the gate from opening again.

Sophie was shocked to see this gorgeous woman wetting herself so quickly. She stared at her crossed, beautiful legs and her clenched fists to the sides of her wet crotch. When she looked up, her eyes met Hanna’s. Hanna looked straight at her and smiled. Was she embarrassed? Or is she really enjoying it?
