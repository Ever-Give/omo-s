Hi guys, a long time ago, I believe on this website, I read a story that I absolutely loved but wasn't able to find again. It was about a school girl who wound up being sent to a strange school where no one was allowed to pee in the toilets. The main character goes to the toilets on her first day and is punished by having to wear a much more revealing outfit on the second day because the headmaster doesn't allow anyone to pee in the bathrooms without punishment. It has even gone so far as to be a sexual thing at the school, and a lot of the girls will pee to get guys attention. I really like it and I've never been able to find it again, please help!

The one you linked here is a really good story, but it's actually not the one I'm looking for. In the story I was thinking of, the protagonist actually gets punished for not wetting herself. She goes to the bathroom instead towards the beginning of the story, but the school rules dictate that she was supposed to wet herself, and the punishment was a more revealing outfit the next day.

That link seems to be the one! I've been looking for years now. I think I first started trying to find it again way back in 2012. Thank you so much!!
