Kana's Desperate Flight

Hi everyone! I've been a lurker on this site for awhile. I'm an avid worldbuilder and lately I have been working on a short story that both showcases my setting and explores my sexual interests. It's a bit lengthy, so I'll space it out into 3 parts. Creative writing was never my strong suit, I always preferred creating my world through art, but there are just some things that are hard to express in a single picture. I think the story turned out OK all things considered, and I hope you enjoy it!

To Mods: I'm a first-time poster, please let me know if there's something I should do differently!

Part 1

Kana sat peacefully by the window, enjoying her second cup of warm jasmine tea. The evening sun was just beginning to touch the horizon, basking the terminal in soft golden light. She gazed absent-mindedly at the departing airships, thinking nostalgically about the past few months in Hyaeroji. Kana looked so stereotypically Serican; slender and elegant, with long flowing black hair and amber eyes that almost seemed to glow in the sunlight. She had a naturally smooth and saturated face, complemented by light but well-done makeup. Today, she was wearing a form-fitting golden losan dress that extended mid-thigh, white tights that showed the curves of her delicate legs, and a pair of heels that made her stand that much taller.

“CNA Flight 54 with service to Sthaeyhang international airport will be boarding in 5 minutes. Please line up at the gate with your travel documents” a voice announced from the speakers overhead. Kana finished the last of her tea and began walking towards the gate. Along the way, a slight twinge in her bladder reminded her that she hadn’t used the bathroom since she arrived at the airport. I'll just go after we board, she thought to herself.

The airship, a brand-new Caetabian A-Class, was sleek, modern, and larger than life; it seemed to fill up the whole window with its form. Caetabian National Airlines operated this international route between the capitals of the two largest eastern nations, and its service was renowned for its excellence. The boarding doors opened to reveal a skybridge that led from the boarding gate into the passenger cabin, sloped slightly upwards. The passengers began to make their way into the contemporary interior adorned with decorations in Caetabian grey and silver.

Kana soon forgot about her need to urinate as her eyes explored the breathtaking interior of the airship. It was certainly much more luxurious than the airship she had come on, with a spacious lounge room with a vaulted ceiling, and private berths down a pair of parallel hallways. All the passengers were lined up in the hallways to get to their cabins, but it was moving at a terribly slow pace.

“Some people just can’t manage to fit a suitcase through a door, can they?” a voice said half-jokingly from behind her. Kana turned around to see a tall and handsome young male dressed in grey robes no older than 20 with a witty grin plastered on his face. Quite the conversation starter he was. She decided to indulge him; the line wasn’t going anywhere anytime soon.

“My mother used to tell me ‘consider how smart the average person is, then consider that half the people are dumber than that. It looks like I’ll be waiting awhile since I’m in cabin 31. It’s a bit of an annoyance, I was going to use the lavatory after i settle by belongings”

“What a coincidence! I’m in cabin 31 as well! I suppose we’re going to get acquainted on this long flight. Oh sorry, I never bothered to introduce myself. I’m Jin. What’s a beautiful young lady such as yourself doing on this flight?”

Kana studied Jin’s narrow face. A pale complexion, dark, mysterious eyes with just a hint of mischief, an upturned nose, and clean shaven facial hair. Most strikingly of all, he was clean-shaven beneath the hood of his mantle. He must’ve been Caetabian; known for their distinctively colorless appearances.

“I’m Kana; pleased to meet you. I was travelling abroad in the Kingdom of Hyaeroji during my season off and now I’m returning to school for my second semester.”

–

Half an hour later, the duo finally made it to cabin 31 at the end of the hallway. The door slid open to the side, revealing a decently sized room perhaps 4 meters in each direction. A pair of bunk beds sat in two corners of the room. In the center was a rectangular table with two seats on either side. A large window with the curtains drawn open let in the evening light. A shelf in the corner held some works of literature.

“After you, my lady” Jin said, opening the sliding door, then he half-jokingly bowed. Kana gave him a hint of a smile and set her suitcase on the luggage rack and placed her purse on one of the chairs.

“I must find the lavatory now. I will return soon.” The Serican woman walked briskly past the open door and towards one of the flight attendants just past the end of the hallway. She was tall and was also clean shaven, and like Jin also complete with the typical pale Caetabian complexion. She wore a CNA flight attendant’s uniform, simple but professional. She found it strange how even women in Caetabia shaved their heads. Was mechanical efficiency and conformity more important than beauty and expression?

“Excuse me, where may I find the lavatory?”

“My apologies miss, we will take off soon. We request for your safety that you remain seated until the airship reaches its cruising altitude. Once we make that announcement, you may use the facilities which are located next to the dining room.” The flight attendant gestured to the left at a pair of doors leading to the men’s and ladies’.

Slightly annoyed, Kana returned to her cabin and sat down on one of the seats, producing a small sketchbook and some pens from her purse.

“Do you enjoy the fine arts?” Jin inquired, as he picked up one of the newspapers from the shelf. The Geopolitical Times the title read.

“I’m attending the National University of Sthaeyhang, Academy of Culture as a sculpting student, though in my free time I enjoy exploring two dimensional mediums as well” she flipped to a blank page in her sketchbook and began sketching the sunset scenery outside the window.

“It must’ve been difficult getting into NUS as a Serican, the expectations are so impossibly high”

“How did you know I’m Serican?”

“Your Hanjol accent is distinctly so.” Kana blushed; she hadn’t realized her pronunciation was so off. Hanjol, the regional lingua franca, was taught in every major eastern nation as a second language. Most eastern nations used somewhat related character scripts and were more or less mutually intelligible, but the spoken languages were quite distinct, which necessitated the need of an international language. She had hoped her time visiting Hyaeroji would’ve improved her oral Hanjol.

“Well, truthfully, it’s easier to apply as a foreigner. We don’t have to take the college entrance exam native Caetabians do, and the admissions council seems to desire a diverse student body.”

The speaker came on, interrupting their conversation.

“Welcome aboard Caetabian National Airlines! Thank you for choosing to fly with us today with nonstop service to Sthaeyhang. We are known for our exceptional punctuality and hospitality. Our flight duration will be roughly 7 hours and 15 minutes. We will be taking off momentarily; after climbing to cruising altitude, our flight attendants will begin with late night tea service. Please remain seated in your cabins until we make our next announcement.”

The door suddenly flew open; a frantic-looking woman in her early 30’s wearing fine emerald green jewelry, black boots and a stunning dress stumbled in. Her three-tiered earrings dangled loosely as she moved; the intricate emerald carvings in her necklace reflected the evening sunlight into a kaleidoscope of colors. The flowy violet dress ended at the breast line, leaving the woman’s shoulder and collarbone exposed. It was tied at the waist by a black ribbon. Her shoulder-length hair was pinned up in a neat bun atop her head. She clearly had an immaculate taste in fashion.

“My apologies! I nearly missed the flight! Why did the gate have to be all the way at the top? The damn elevator was stopping on every floor on the way!”

“Perhaps you can try arriving early next time, madam.” Jin remarked sarcastically. It seemed these sarcastic remarks were his thing.

The woman scowled at him before speaking again.

“Well, nice to meet you too. I’m Imiyo. I’m from the Emerald Isles.” She declared, ignoring the irksome remark.

The airship began to move, first undocking from the gate, before gently ascending into the sky. It used a complex system of variable control surfaces and propellers to maneuver effortlessly towards their flight path. The soft humming of the engines was barely audible in the passenger cabin on these newer aircraft.

“It looks like it’s just the three of us today.” Imiyo observed, sitting down in one of the remaining empty chairs. “Usually these flights are packed, every cabin full.”

“‘The Empire of the Sun has decisively defeated the Kingdom of Atlantis at the second battle of Alexandra.’ Well I certainly didn’t expect this development. It’s been awhile since the Eagle of the west had its wings clipped.” Jin remarked as he read the headline in the newspaper.

“The Empire of the Sun, isn’t that the nation across the mountains from Caetabia? I’ve heard of that name before, but don’t know much about it. I’m not such a politically inclined person.”

“Well, their relationship with the rest of the world is strained at best. They’re something of a pariah state these days. Rumors have it that they have been planning something big…they’ve been secretly building up their military and increasing their influence here in the east.”

“Come to think of it, I did notice quite a few preachers proselytizing on the streets and churches with that sun symbol on it when I was in Angchae. I was wondering what that was all about.”

“Hyaeroji hasn’t forgotten their defeat in the war of the colonies a few decades ago. The east seems peaceful now, but animosity is bubbling beneath the surface. All it’ll take is one spark for the flames of war to ignite once again.”

“Do you fancy yourself a fortune teller?” Imiyo asked.

“I’m in apprenticeship for the Caetabian ministry of History, so perhaps that counts. Although, we at the ministry make predictions of the future not from arcane divinations but rather through careful analysis of empirical data. They say history doesn’t necessarily repeat itself, but it does rhyme.”

“Imiyo, was it? What’s an Emeraldine doing all the way in Caetabia?”

“My job is located there. I work as a jewelry smith there, but the mine is only open 9 months of the year. The other 3 months I spent back home in the Emerald Isles. I take this commute pretty often!”

Kana had finished her drawing of the evening landscape and had moved on to sketch a kirin, using her pens to color its skin a golden shade. The Kirin was the national animal of Serica; a relic from the time of the ancients; a time when the east was united under a single nation whose strength rivaled the three superpowers.

–

A few moments later, a soft knock came at the door of the cabin. The door slid open, revealing a flight attendant with the beverage trolley. She looked to be Concordian, middle-aged and had a friendly smile on her face.

“Would you all like some freshly steeped tea? We have rose, skyberry, and lavender chamomile varieties.”

“I’ll have the lavender chamomile, please.” Kana replied. The flight attendant took out a tea set with elegant grey embroidery and poured the lightly steaming tea into the cup. As the other two passengers made their orders, Kana began sipping the delicious herbal tea; its rich aromatic scent enhancing its flavor. Kana hadn’t realized how exhausted she was after a long day of travel; the sun had already traversed the horizon, the last vestiges of orange and red in the sky being replaced by the violet of night and the twinkling of the first stars. The warm and calming tea only made her feeling of drowsiness heavier. She stood up from the table and made her way to the bottom left bunk, removing her heels and placing them neatly on the floor, before descending beneath the covers. The conversation between Jin and Imiyo, something about the intricacies of Jitengist philosophy, gradually faded to the background as she fell asleep.

–

Kana stirred from her slumber, her half-lidded eyes adjusting to the soft light of the cabin. The lights were dimmed, and Jin and Imiyo were now asleep. Her sketchbook and pens were still strewn about the table where she’d last left them. A sharp pang cut through her abdomen, making her breath catch. Her mind snapped awake, a tide of regret washing over her as she recalled ignoring her body’s earlier warnings.

“Shit! I was so tired I forgot to use the toilet before I fell asleep!”

Swinging her legs over the side, she slipped into her heels and moved quickly toward the lavatory. Each step sent another wave of urgency through her.

By now, most of the passengers were asleep, and the lights inside the airship were dimmed. Kana had put off her need for long enough; now she had to acquiesce to her aching bladder. She walked across the dining room towards the inviting symbol of the ladies’ room, turning the handle on the door in anticipation of relief.

Locked.

“I apologize miss, the lavatory is out of order.” The female Caetabian flight attendant from earlier informed her apologetically from behind the bar. Her thighs involuntarily pressed together, her body being denied the relief that was just on the horizon a few seconds ago.

“When will it become available again?” Kana asked with an edge of desperation in her voice.

“The lavatory ventilation hydraulic systems malfunctioned an hour ago, and we had to seal both doors to prevent a depressurization of the cabin. There’s no risk to the safety of the airship, however it means the lavatories will have to remain closed for the rest of the flight.” She responded solemnly.

The attractive Serican lady glanced at the clock, which showed half past midnight, which meant there were still just over 2 hours left in the flight. 2 hours? That felt like an eternity. Her face became crestfallen with the prospect of having to hold it in until they landed.

“If it helps, could I offer some compensatory desserts?” the flight attendant pipped, trying to ease the anxiety present on Kana’s face. She opened the ice chest and brought forth an Essence of WInter, a traditional Hyaerojiese delicacy made from Moon Tears, honey, and crystallized sugar.

The flavor was exquisite; the Moon Tear fruit had a jelly-like texture, with faint floral undertones. It was just like all the times she had enjoyed this dish in the high-end restaurants of Angchae. Still, Kana’s legs remained tightly pressed together, her need becoming so great not even the best dessert in all the seven kingdoms could take her mind off it

“I’m truly sorry about the predicament I’ve put you in, I promise from the great heavens that incidents such as these are exceedingly rare. Please don’t let this tarnish our airline’s image.” the flight attendant continued, still looking remorseful.

“It wasn’t your fault. Besides this, the service has been nothing but excellent so far. To be honest, this is my own mistake; I had multiple opportunities to relieve myself earlier. I suppose I took lavatory access for granted.”

The flight attendant removed the now empty plate from the counter.

“Perhaps try to distract yourself with something until we land, we’ll be there in no time.”

Part 2

Kana had tried to distract herself in the last hour by sketching some more, but the now intense pressure from her bladder made that impossible. She sorely regretted having so many cups of tea at the airport and on the airship; the diuretic side effects of which seemed to only increase her urge. She crossed and uncrossed her legs, squeezing them together periodically, but her nervous squirming gave no solace. Finally, she couldn’t take it anymore. She ambled over to the bunk where Imiyo laid peacefully on the bed, hopefully having better dreams than whatever nightmare Kana was in, and gently prodded her.

“Imiyo. Imiyo, please wake up!” She whisper-shouted. Jin couldn’t know of her predicament; how embarrassing would it be to be seen in such a sorry state by an attractive young man!

“Hmm? What’s the occasion?” Imiyo responded groggily; Kana felt bad for rousing her from such a deep slumber but she had to think of something.

“I’ve been holding my pee all day since I got to the airport but when I tried to go, the lavatory was out of order, and I've been absolutely bursting ever since!”

This got the Emeraldine woman’s attention, and she sat up in her covers.

“You poor thing! How can I help?” she said, a bit too loudly.

“Shh! Please be more quiet, Jin mustn't know…but I was hoping you could come up with something, I just don’t know what to do.”

“I don’t understand why the newest commercial airships somehow only have one set of bathrooms on board, seems like something like this was a disaster waiting to happen! How long do we have until we land?” Imiyo whispered a bit more discreetly this time.

“About an hour, given nothing else out of the ordinary occurs.”

“Do you think you can make it to the airport bathroom?”

“I…I don’t know, I really do have to go quite badly.” Kana said sheepishly.

Imiyo, now fully awake, considered the younger girl’s options for a moment.

“That teapot is mostly empty, you could pee in it, and then we just have to find a way to dispose of it.”

Kana appeared mortified by the prospect of urinating in a teapot.

“That’s disgraceful!”

“Do you want to try the trash bin instead?” She remarked half-sarcastically before continuing.

“I’ve considered everything, and I don’t think there are too many good options in your situation. You can either risk wetting yourself before we land or go for the pot.”

Reluctantly, Kana had to accept this painful reality; that she was stuck on an airship with no functioning bathroom with the possibility of letting it all out in her leggings.

“I…I suppose I will use the pot.”

Making sure Jin was still fast asleep on the top left bunk, Kana placed the expensive looking teapot on the floor and began gingerly pulling her leggings and panties down.

“Please don’t look!” The now half-naked woman pulled her dress up and out of the way and squatted over the pot. Imiyo couldn’t help but steal a quick glance at Kana’s curvy butt and soft, delicate thighs, before looking away again. The sound of liquid being released slowly at first then more rapidly filled up the room.

The relief was incredible. It felt like a dam being opened and thousands and thousands of tons of water being allowed to freely flow. Kana closed her eyes and tried to stifle a soft moan as the intense pressure slowly began to ease itself. She felt as if she had reached enlightenment and ascended to the west sky; her body felt like it was almost weightless after bearing such a heavy burden. But glancing down and noticing the teapot nearly filled to the brim brought her back to reality, panic rising in her eyes.

“Shit!”

Kana desperately raced to stem the flow, letting loose a few erratic spurts as the floodgates finally closed. She still felt a burning sensation in her crotch, the rest of the tide begging to be released. How could one pee so much and still feel so full?

A sudden knock on the door got the attention of both women.

“Excuse me, we must collect the silverware from all cabins before we land. Would you like me to retrieve your tea set?”

Kana hastily pulled her leggings up. There was no time to wipe or anything to wipe with; the last droplets moistened the seat of her pants.

“Uh…we–we still have some left to finish!” Imiyo replied, thinking quickly.

“That’s alright, I’ll collect yours after everyone else’s. Please finish your beverage before then.” The sound of the flight attendant’s footsteps faded down the hallway.

“We only have a few minutes to dispose of this!”

“Wait here. Leave this to me.” Slowly opening the door, Imiyo checked both ways to make sure the coast was clear before dashing towards the kitchen. At this time in the middle of the night, the kitchen should be empty. Indeed, the lights were off; everything neat and tidy for the next day of service.

I hope the staff doesn’t mind the scent of human waste she thought to herself, pouring the contents of the container into the drain, giving it a quick rinse under the sink before returning to the cabin and replacing the teapot to its original position on the tray not a moment too soon. The two women held their breath as the flight attendant returned to the cabin to collect the tray. Thankfully, she didn’t bat an eye as she placed the tray on her trolley and left without a hint of suspicion.The moment Imiyo closed the door, Kana buried her hands in her crotch and doubled over in pain.

“That only made it worse, I still have to urinate so desperately, and now it feels like the rest is going to come out at any moment!” Kana’s amber eyes began to grow moist, unable to contain her emotion any longer.

Comforting others was never Imiyo’s strong suit, but she had to give it a shot. Even if they were mere strangers, she couldn't bear the sight of seeing another woman in such a sorry state: sobbing uncontrollably; legs bent inwards; and unable to control her own body. She sat beside Kana, delicately placing a hand on her shoulder.

“Hey hey hey, don’t cry! Think about it. There’s no possible way that you released so much and became more full. That idea probably saved you an extra hour to find a lavatory. You’ll definitely make it! I believe in you. Look at me.”

Kana finally looked up, making eye contact with Imiyo.

“Can you tell me about university? I’ve always wanted to attend NUS! Are your classes difficult? Any attractive men you have your sights on?

Taking a deep breath, Kana tried to calm herself. Imiyo was right, panicking right now would do her no good. She was going to keep her bladder under control, no matter what.

“Uh…w–well the campus is beautiful, the central atrium is over six stories high…”

–

Jin felt awful, as if he pushed an elderly man off a bridge. Why am I such an idiot? He thought to himself. Not only had he seriously compromised up his own mission, he had also inadvertently deprived this innocent woman of the toilet! He had been awake to hear the events unfolding for the last hour, but what good would waking up do? It would just make things more awkward than they already were; he decided it was best to feign sleep.

The truth was that Jin had lied. Lied about his apprenticeship at the ministry of history. Lied about his nationality. Jin wasn’t even his real name. He didn’t like to think of himself as a bad person; there were certain boundaries he set for himself, but everyone had to put food on the table, somehow. And he had just inadvertently crossed one of those boundaries. Don’t cause harm to those who don’t deserve it.

–

“Passengers, we will be landing at Sthaeyhang International Airport shortly. On our descent, please be advised that this region is prone to storms at this time of year. We will likely have to descend through storm clouds, which will cause turbulence. Please make sure to remain seated and grab the nearest handhold if possible.”

Only 30 minutes until relief. She tried to focus on her conversation, but subconsciously she was ticking down the minutes until she could leave this godforsaken airship. Her bladder had quickly filled up again; the lovely lavender chamomile tea having now run its course.

“I can’t believe such a prestigious professor would be involved in a scandal like that!” Imiyo giggled, finding it hilarious that these incidents still happened even in the most acclaimed institution in the whole world.

Suddenly a huge jolt rocked the airship, catching Kana off guard. Her breath caught in her throat as she involuntarily leaked a few more drops into her already damp underwear. Grimacing, she clenched her sphincter tightly.

“What’s wrong?” Imiyo asked, becoming concerned.

“The turbulence made me let out a little bit.” She was more prepared for the second sudden change in acceleration, this time accompanied by a fierce-looking flash of lightning. Airships were notoriously poor under bad weather; their light frames and large canopy making them easy for the winds to batter around. Normally routes traversing such would be avoided, but the approach into Sthaeyhang was surrounded on all sides by winter storms at this time of year.

The moments after the announcement felt like an eternity for Kana. She squirmed slightly in her seat, glancing at the clock on the wall. Twenty-nine minutes. Could she make it? She tried to distract herself by rejoining the conversation.

"Honestly," Kana said, forcing a smile, "I think that professor just had it coming. The faculty might be prestigious, but they’re still just people, right?"

Imiyo laughed, leaning in as if sharing a secret. "True, but I heard from a friend that the whole thing started over a love letter. Can you believe that? The student wanted to be discreet, but they mailed it to the professor's spouse by mistake!"

Despite herself, Kana chuckled, imagining the chaos. The laughter eased the tension well, maybe a little too well. A leak nearly escaped into her underwear, but she caught herself in the nick of time. She crossed her legs tightly, her smile faltering.

“Are you alright?” Imiyo asked, noticing her expression.

Kana waved her off. “No it’s nothing. Just a little turbulence.” She shifted uncomfortably. Twenty minutes. Imiyo could sense Kana was nearing the end of her rope; her words doing nothing to hide the pained expression on her face.

Suddenly, another sharp jolt rocked the cabin. The lights flickered, and passengers gasped as the airship creaked under the strain. Kana’s hands instinctively shot to the armrests, and she squeezed her thighs together as tightly as she could. A fresh wave of desperation hit her, and this time, she felt the faint warmth of a leak.

The captain’s voice crackled through the intercom, calm but firm.

“Ladies and gentlemen, please remain seated. We’re experiencing heavier turbulence than anticipated. Hold on tightly and remain in your seats for the remainder of the descent.”

A shiver ran down Kana’s spine. Severe turbulence? For another fifteen minutes? She glanced at the window, watching as lightning illuminated the swirling storm clouds outside. The violent gales rocked the airship from side to side; the floor beneath them pitching and rolling. If Imiyo hadn’t been so accustomed to travelling by boat, she certainly would’ve been seasick by now.

Imiyo reached out, placing a hand on Kana’s arm. “I’m sure we’ll be fine. Storms like this are commonplace.”

Kana nodded mechanically, barely hearing her. Ten minutes. She squeezed her eyes shut, counting each breath, her heart pounding in her chest. Each time the airship jolted, she felt her control slipping. Another spurt escaped, and she bit her lip to suppress a groan. Her leggings were definitely wet now, and she prayed it wouldn’t seep through to the seat.

The final stretch of the descent felt like a cruel test of endurance. Imiyo tried to keep the conversation going, but Kana could barely form coherent responses. She was trapped in her own private purgatory, every jolt and sway of the airship mocking her struggle.

At last, the airship emerged from the clouds; the gleaming airport lights of Sthaeyhang international airport in sight from the window. Kana sat hunched over in her chair, hands pressed between her thighs, face full of concentration, perspiration running down her forehead from the persistent effort needed to go against her body’s instincts to void the golden liquid all over the floor. Five minutes.

“We’re almost there! I wonder if any of the restaurants at the airport are still open.” Imiyo exclaimed in her ever optimistic mood.

The airship had now approached the skybridge and began its steady docking process. One minute. She had no time to waste; the desperate girl couldn’t afford to be trapped in a slow moving line again. The margins were razor thin; stakes high. Her pride and dignity were on the line. She had to risk it and try to get off before everyone else.

“I can’t waste a single second more!” the Serican woman cried, leaving a stunned Imiyo behind as she suddenly dashed out of the room and down the hallway before the airship had even come to a complete stop.

Thanks for reading so far! I made a drawing of Kana I wanted to show as well 🙂

Part 3

Jin sat up slowly, faking a yawn and stretching to give the illusion he had been asleep the whole time.

“Wake up, sleepyhead. We’re about to land.”

“Where did Kana run off too?” her abrupt flight from the room had surprised him as well.

“She’s…gone to purchase some merchandise from the store before we land.” Jin knew that was a lie, but pretended to buy it. A timid girl like Kana probably would’ve died of embarrassment if she knew a boy had been watching her whole ordeal. He didn’t really need the extra attention anyways, after this botched job he’d have to seek a new source of employment again.

–

Passengers please remain seated and exit the aircraft in an orderly fashion. The temperature is currently mildly chilly, with light winds blowing to the east–

Kana paid no heed to the announcement, the rest of its contents becoming a blur. The sole thing on her mind was being able to plop herself onto a toilet seat and unleash a torrent of pee into the toilet bowl. The Caetabian flight attendant from earlier, cognisant of her situation, allowed her to deboard prematurely without a word. Another wave of desperation threatened to topple the tenuous control she still held over her sphincter. She grabbed her crotch with an iron grip and crossed her legs. The walk through the skybridge was agonizing, each step seeming to intensify the searing pain, until she made it to the terminal. Her eyes darted around wildly, finally finding their mark. Bathroom, ahead and to the right. The end of her nightmare was within grasp. She desperately stumbled in that direction, a hand maintained tightly wedged between her legs as if it would physically stop her from peeing.

As she turned around the corner, the two glowing bathroom signs almost seemed like a godsend. The sight of them and the thought of relief made her release a short spurt, further dampening her already wet undergarments. The tortured woman moaned as she struggled to stem the flow. Just a little bit longer she pleaded to herself. She burst into the bathroom, attempting to open the first stall. Occupied. The second stall? Also occupied. As she got to the last stall, she prayed it was open, but she was mortified when she found it too was occupied. It almost seemed like the universe was playing a cruel joke on her; she had made it this far only for all the godforsaken stalls to be in use! Kana banged on the stall door violently and begged whoever was inside to give her some mercy. An outburst like this was normally unthinkable for such a shy and reserved individual like her, but Kana’s bladder had completely taken control of her instincts.

“Please…! Please open the door! I can’t wait any longer. I am absolutely bursting and I’m going to wet myself!” she wailed. But she had run out of time. Kana whimpered as another powerful spurt sent streaks of urine running down her tight leggings, turning the white fabric translucent. She was only able to stem the tide momentarily before another jet of hot pee forced itself out of her sphincter with enough pressure to send some of the liquid splattering to the floor. The woman who had fought so hard to keep her dignity was losing the battle against her own body. In a last ditch effort, she jammed the fabric of her dress into her crotch with both hands, but it was like trying to stop a river with a plank of wood. Her tortured bladder could no longer bear the weight of its load. Half a day’s worth of pent-up pee exploded from her crotch, producing an audible hissing sound.

She couldn’t help but moan as the contents of her bladder now violently voided itself, entrancing her mind in a state of blissful relief. The cascade of urine flooded the remaining dry spots on her leggings before spraying in all directions, drenching the hem of her dress where she had pressed it into her crotch. It pooled in her heels and on the tile around her feet, the puddle gradually expanding. Kana stood there leaning against the door with knees turned inward and hands in crotch violently wetting her pants.The waterfall seemed to last an eternity before the stream finally began dying down. As she was brought back to the material world, the realization of what she’d done became overwhelming. She slowly slumped to the floor in a pool of her own steaming urine, sobbing hysterically.

“I soiled myself! I–I couldn’t even wait to use the bathroom like an absolute child! How could I be so obtuse?” the poor woman choked out between sobs, both in anger and frustration at herself for not going when she had the chance and the universe for bringing such misfortune upon her. The door to the second stall opened, and a robed middle-aged woman stared in shock at the scene before her before awkwardly scurrying away, not wishing to remain in the company of this disaster. Kana ran into the stall, slamming and locking the door behind her. How ironic that only after she had already relieved herself involuntarily that she would be able to sit upon the porcelain throne. She kicked off her pee-soaked shoes and brought her knees to her chest, her hysterical sobbing evolving into soft and pained crying.

–

When Kana hadn’t come back to retrieve her purse and suitcase, Imiyo began to grow worried.

“Jin, sorry to burden you as a stranger but could you help unload our bags? I’m going to check on Kana.”

Jin just nodded wordlessly with a grim look on his face, inquiring no further. Judging earlier by the desperation on the Serican woman’s face, he could guess the likely outcome.

Imiyo weaved between the crowd of passengers, catching a few angry remarks as she passed them.

“Apologies! Sorry! Excuse me!”

She raced through the terminal and followed the neon signs pointing to the bathroom. When she got there, she noticed one occupied stall. Soft crying and sniffling noises could be heard. Imiyo gently knocked on the stall door.

“Kana, it’s me. Are you ok? Can I come in?”

The door slowly opened just a crack and Imiyo pushed it open the rest of the way, stepping into the narrow stall before closing the door behind her. Kana sat, teary-eyed, on the toilet. Her makeup was ruined, dark smudges tracing the path that teardrops took down her face. Her outfit was a mess; leggings and dress completely soaked from the waist down. Her shoes lay haphazardly on the bathroom floor; also drenched in urine. The girl clearly hadn’t made it to the toilet in time.

“Hey, accidents happen to the best of us. It wasn’t your fault.” Kana sniffled but didn’t respond, allowing Imiyo to help her to her feet.

Outside, the terminal was dark besides the few synthetic lights and the occasional flashes of lightning providing dim illumination. It was a starless sky around the airport, entirely obstructed by menacing storm clouds. Jin stood there by the bathroom entrance with their bags, face a mix of a million emotions.

“Kana, I’m truly sorry for what I’ve put you through. I’m not who you think I am, and I don’t want to cause more trouble than I already have. Here, please take this for your troubles.”

He handed the still despondent Kana a nondescript grey envelope, took his suitcase, and with that turned on his heel walked off into the vastness of the airport without another word.

Imiyo took the envelope from Kana and opened it for her, revealing a wad of thousand-dollar Caetabian Basit bills bound in ribbon.

Kana remained silent, barely processing the words Jin had just said, her mind still replaying the humiliating events in agonizing detail. It was a day she’d never be able to forget, forever branded into her memory. But the warmth in Imiyo’s voice was like a lifeline, pulling her out of the storm of her thoughts.

“Oh, my goodness… This is a fortune!” she whispered, her hands trembling as she flipped through the crisp bills. Imiyo shook her head, a wry smile on her face. “Looks like we’ve got a mystery on our hands. But for now, let’s focus on you. Why don’t you come to my place, get cleaned up, and maybe I’ll introduce you to the best pastries in the world. My grandmother used to say ‘sweets can mend a broken heart.’” Sounds alright?”

For the first time all day, Kana managed a small, grateful smile. Maybe this was the start of something good after all.
