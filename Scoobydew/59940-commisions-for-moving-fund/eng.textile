As I am currently in the process of moving to another state, I find myself feeling the need to get some funds to help out with things... SO! I will be opening $30 commisions (That's one cent per word, so you will get a minimum of 3000 words per drabble, most likely more!). I am flexible as far as kink content, and am familiar with a wide variety of settings for both video games and anime! Said settings include:

Warcraft

Final Fantasy (Especially FFXIV)

Elder Scrolls

The Fate series

Sword Art Online

Log Horizon

Rising of the Shield Hero

Angel Beats

No Game No Life

Maid-sama!

That Time I was Reincarnated as a Slime

Toradora!

Seton Acadamy: Join the Pack!

And more!

I do research for any characters or settings I'm not 100% familiar with as well, as I want to ensure I capture scenes in their entirety. Once I get started on a project I also tend to power through and complete it in a massive push as well, sometimes doing both the rough draft and final draft in one night (Not healthy I know, but I ride the wave when I get it)

Please help out a catgirl writer in her time of need! =^_^= ♥
