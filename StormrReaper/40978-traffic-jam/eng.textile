"Pass the water its hot!" exclaimed Mckenzie as she held her face against the A/C.

"Be careful on how much you drink, this traffic is heavy, and there isnt another pit stop for awhile yet." I said looking at her.

"I'm a big girl, I know how much I can hold" she said with a cute grin.

I loved this smile, because it meant she absolutely was not going to make it. She was a slim tan girl. wearing a hollister tanktop and black leggings with sandals. she has blonde hair and green eyes.

We haven't stopped in hours and she was already holding her thighs close together, an obvious sign she had to go.

She looked at me and smiled "I gotta pee, like really bad" she said

I look over to see her hand in her leggings holding herself to prevent urine from escaping.

"I told you to not drink so much." I scolded

She smiled ya know, I've leaked every now and then I'm soo wet already" She said cutely. "I could just let go"

"Do it" I dared

"Fine"

Within seconds i heard a hiss and i could see a puddle growing under her as she moaned loudly with relief. once she finished she began rubbing herself.

When we hit the next town wanna rent a hotel room. I got plans" She said seductively.

Looking at her piss darkened leggings and at the masturbating girl beside me i readily agreed.
