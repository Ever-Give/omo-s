Well, let's see how rusty I am at this. Hi. Hope you're all doing as well as possible 🙂

***

“So let’s raise a glass to the bride and groom and the awesome adventure they’re embarking on!”

Dylan whooped and held up his champagne glass at the best man’s command. He glanced around his table and couldn’t help but beam at the joy he saw on his friends’ faces.

Josh and Caylee were the first couple from their 10-person college friend group to get married. Three years after graduation, this wedding felt like a gateway to real adulthood. They’d all moved on to grad school or nascent careers, but most of these past few years had felt, to Dylan, like playing pretend. How could they really all be grown-ups? There was so much to know, so much to take care of.

Now that two of his best friends were married, though, Dylan could see more clearly how far they’d all come. Maybe they could do this whole maturity thing. Maybe he could…

Dylan looked over at Gina, her smile radiant in the low light of the reception tent. He and Gina had dated for a bit in college, but then she’d stayed to get her MBA, and he’d left to work at an engineering firm in Chicago. They’d both agreed that neither of them had the capacity for a long-distance relationship, and the split had been more than amicable.

Still.

Dylan gulped down his champagne, wrinkling his nose at the fizz, then took a drink of water. Caylee was her parents’ only daughter, and every detail of the gorgeous beach wedding was of the highest quality, including the open bar. The large tent had two long bars, one at each end, stocked with a variety of liquor, wine, and beer that Dylan had never encountered, but had already taken advantage of.

The DJ had started the music again, and people were drifting up from their tables, heading toward the dance floor, the dessert table, or the bars. Dylan looked around at their octet.

“Anyone want another round?”

Gina, Ashlyn, Dakota, and Isaac all assented, calling out their respective orders (two vodka cranberries, a Riesling, and a Stella. Logan stood, pulling out his wallet.

“Pretty sure this round of tips is mine,” Logan said. “I’ll help carry.”

The chorus of thank-yous from their table blending with the music as Logan eased between the chairs to join Dylan.

“Be more obvious, bro,” Logan said under his breath, smirking.

Dylan felt his ears warm. There was no need to even ask what Logan meant.

“That bad?” Dylan replied, almost not wanting to hear the answer.

Logan shrugged. “You ask if anyone wants another round, but you’re only staring at her. You pretend like you’re looking around the whole table, but you keep coming back to her.”

Dylan winced slightly. Logan, maybe more than anyone in the group, knew that Dylan hadn’t stopped caring for Gina when they broke up.

“I don’t wanna be that guy.” Dylan kept his voice low as they joined the line at the bar. “The one who just pines and thinks I have some claim on G just because I’m not over her.”

Logan shrugged again, well-practiced at staying neutral among his friends’ various spats and romantic entanglements. “You’re still friends. There was no hatred or anything.”

The line moved forward, and Dylan couldn’t help but glance around to see if anyone was listening.

“And she’s done with her internship, and God knows there’s plenty of accounting work in Chicago,” Logan continued.

Dylan looked up, staring plaintively at his friend as they stepped up to the next free bartender. He pasted on a smile, turning to give their order.

“…a Stella, a…” Dylan turned for Logan to fill in his order.

“A Guinness,” Logan supplied, and Dylan rolled his eyes. He would never understand Logan’s love for stout.

“And a double bourbon on the rocks,” Dylan finished.

Logan raised his eyebrows, and it was Dylan’s turn to shrug.

“If I’m gonna be initiating any sort of conversation with G, I’m gonna need a bit more liquid courage.”

Suppressing a grin, Logan clapped Dylan on the shoulder before reaching for the first prepared drinks. “I won’t tell you which way I bet in the pool.”

Dylan reached for the remaining drinks, triangulating the glasses in his hands. “If y’all actually have a pool…”

Logan laughed but didn’t say anything more as they approached their table, setting down the drinks for distribution. Dylan grabbed his bourbon and took a large swig before anyone could comment on the size of the pour. The whiskey warmed his throat on the way down, the awareness of the alcohol temporarily strengthening his belief that he could do this. He could ask Gina if she was willing to give their relationship another shot.

Not right now, though. Dylan grabbed for his water glass, almost unconsciously (gotta stay properly hydrated). The sun had properly set, now that the cocktail hour, the introductions, the first dances, the dinner, and the speeches, were all done. All that was left was hours of dancing and plenty of opportunity to sneak out onto the beach for private conversations.

Taking another sip of whiskey, Dylan started to form a loose plan. He’d be casual. They would dance and talk as a group, enjoying the drinks and food and music. He’d spend some time close to Gina, but not exclusively. He wanted her to be part of the group, maybe soaking in the same feeling of true adulthood that he was feeling. He wanted her to enjoy time with their friends and be as happy as possible before he broached the topic of dating again.

Dylan threw back the rest of his drink. The slight burn heightened his existing buzz from the champagne and the cocktail hour. He took a second to take stock of his level of intoxication and decided that he’d need to be a tiny bit more drunk – but not much – to talk to Gina. Just enough to feel happy and get past the inhibitions. Nothing sloppy.

The opening bars of Fancy Like burst from the speakers, and they all yelped at the semi-ironic song from their senior year. Glasses were hastily set down as they rushed to the dance floor.

The dance floor was large, so even with a couple hundred enthusiastic guests, it wasn’t crowded. The DJ was brilliant, playing a seamless mix of broadly popular songs, mixed enough so that no demographic at the wedding felt left out for too long.

Amidst the eager if not skilled dancers, Dylan couldn’t help but keep looking over at Gina. He tried to move around so that it didn’t look like he was glued by her side the whole time, but he was utterly captivated.

He swore she was sparkling. The dangling lanterns hanging around the edge of the tent made for flattering illumination, and the colored lights around the DJ booth added an ethereal quality.

A song Dylan didn’t recognize came on, and he took the chance to head back to the bar – just for a beer this time. He wanted something to nurse on to keep his buzz going. He sat back at the table for a bit, suddenly aware that he was breathing hard from the dancing. He took a bigger drink of beer than he’d meant, then intentionally switched to his refilled water glass.

Before long, the song ended, and the DJ was announcing a “slow down.” His friends were making their way back to the table. Just as Gina was reaching for her chair, Glad You Exist started to play.

“Ohhhh!” Gina cooed hopefully. She locked eyes with Dylan, ad he felt his heart stutter. He knew she loved this song.

He stood, trying desperately to play it cool.

“May I?” He reached out a hand to Gina, praying to any deity available that he looked gallant, not desperate.

But Gina’s smile was wide and genuine as she took his arm, and Dylan swore she’d be able to feel his heartbeat through his skin.

The song was on the upbeat side of slow. Dylan pulled from his memories of the swing classes that the girls would drag them to in college as he attempted some spins and turns. Gina had ditched her heels, so their height disparity was bigger than usual. Dylan looked down and just barely had the presence of mind to recognize that his belief that Gina’s eyes were sparkling was some trite romantic bullshit, and he didn’t care one bit.

They swayed together as the song ended far too soon (Dylan had the flash of a memory of hating how short the song was back in college, because it meant less time to dance with Gina), and Gina lightly took his hand as she pulled away, leading him back to their table.

Dylan was torn between elation at their dance and an intense desire to keep her on the floor for however many remaining slow songs the DJ would play in this set, but his emotional tension was cut short by a physical pull.

He fought back a grunt as he realized that he had to pee. A quick mental assessment confirmed that it had been several hours since he’d visited the bathroom before the cocktail hour, and he’d had several drinks since then. He should probably go soon, but Gina was still softly holding his hand.

“You guys are so cuuuuuuute,” Dakota sang as they approached the table. The remaining 6 alums were seated, refreshing and replenishing while couples took over the dance floor.

Dylan hoped he wasn’t blushing too noticeably, but Logan was already talking.

“G, what were you saying about the job search?” he asked, adding, in case his question wasn’t leading enough, “Where are you looking to go next?”

Gina smiled shyly, looking down. And was that a quick glance in Dylan’s direction? There was no way he was going to leave for the bathroom in the middle of this conversation.

“Well, obviously, a big city would be great,” Gina was saying. “There are non-profits everywhere who need accounting and tax help, but there will definitely be a bigger variety in cities, so I feel like I could do more good.”

“Dyl, you’ve loved Chicago, right?” Bo chimed in.

Dylan shifted in his seat. So this was a coordinated play, for sure. Luckily, he really did like living in Chicago and didn’t have to come up with a lie to tell Gina.

“It’s amazing,” he said. “The food, the sports…just all the options. I really like it.”

Out of the corner of his eye, Dylan saw movement from his left. Logan was nudging another beer in front of him; he must have gotten a refill for Dylan at the bar. Dylan knew more liquid wasn’t the most intelligent choice right this second, but “I really like it” wasn’t exactly Shakespeare, so he grabbed the glass for something to do with his mouth that wasn’t saying something banal.

Gina looked at him sideways. “I actually have a few interviews with firms around the Chicago area,” she admitted. “I’ll let you know when I’m in town for the meetings.”

Dylan swallowed a way-too-big gulp of beer, feeling the pressure in his bladder instantly. He was sure his voice was shaking as he said “Yeah, definitely. Keep me updated.”

The corner of Gina’s mouth twitched, and her eyes crinkled at the sides. “I will.”

Unsure of what else he could say, Dylan raised his glass to his mouth again, feeling unaccountably parched. Thankfully, the DJ seemed to have his back, and started up the good old Cha Cha Slide.

“Yesssssss, line dances!” Ashlyn cheered, dragging back Dakota and Isaac’s chairs on either side of her.

Standing with the rest of them, Dylan felt an insistent tug from his bladder. Somewhere in his mind, he knew that heading straight to the bathroom right this second was a smart choice, but the rest of his head was swimming with more alcohol than he’d intended and the lighter-than-air hope that Gina would end up in Chicago, and they’d live happily ever after.

Plus, he thought, as he followed his friends back out to the dance floor, they all owed Josh this dance. At one of their first parties together in college, they’d all learned of Josh’s earnest love for any and all line dancing, and it had become a tradition for them to request at least one line dance any time they went out.

Sure enough, Josh and Caylee were beckoning animatedly from the middle of the dance floor, and the group obligingly lined up around them. For the first half of the song or so, the buoyancy of nostalgia, combined with that last glass of beer had Dylan laughing out loud as he and his friends took it back, y’all.

During the first “Reverse!”, however, Dylan felt a surge of urgency that had him stumbling. He whipped his head to the side to see if anyone noticed, but everyone was still grinning and dancing in time.

Sweating, Dylan clenched his muscles and tried to smile. He knew the song was long, but surely he could handle a few more minutes.

Luckily, the direct instructions from the lyrics kept him from noticeably screwing up any further, though even with the easy 4-counts, Dylan grew more and more aware of his drunken state.

He really shouldn’t have chugged down that last beer. He knew he was too drunk now to have a real conversation with Gina. He’d have to drink more water and wait awhile. He didn’t want to be slurring or pleading. He wasn’t a lightweight, but he’d had a few drinks during cocktail hour, plus a Jack and Coke during dinner, then the champagne, and then the double bourbon and two beers since.

Mentally calculating his alcohol intake was a bad plan. That was way more than he’d planned, and he really hadn’t drunk more than a beer or two at a time since graduation. Dylan felt his head start to spin, and was that a leak??

Dylan pressed his thighs together, vaguely trying to style it out as a stumble as the song ended. He loosely attempted to smile before turning to make his way off the dance floor.

The music kept going of course, though Dylan couldn’t tell what the next song was. The colors lights blurred together as he walked toward the side of the tent, making an effort to move in a straight-ish line so as not to betray his intoxication.

He stumbled against as he stepped out of the tent, the move from floor to sand catching him off guard. The unexpected change of support cost him another leak, and he couldn’t help but whine.

He moved forward, less steady than he wanted to be on the sand. He clenched his thigh and groin muscles again, begging to hang on until he reached the bathrooms.

Where were the bathrooms? Dylan looked around frantically as he walked. They were supposed to be out here, right? There was a walkway out from the side of the tent over to a little building set up down the beach.

Dylan looked down, confirming what his feet on the sand obviously already told him. He wasn’t on any walkway. The pressure from his bladder surged again, and he had to twist his legs together to keep control as he looked back toward the tent. His vision swam with alcohol and the beginning of tears, but he could see lights out the other wide. He’d come the wrong way.

Another searing leak forced its way through his underwear, snaking down his left thigh. Dylan turned his back to the tent and shoved his hand between his legs, squeezing for dear life.

There was no way he could walk back through – or even around – the tent like this.

The darkness in front of him was intense against the lights from the tent. Dylan looked to his right, out toward the water. The beach was wide, and he remembered steps down toward the lower tier of sand. If he could just make it down there, it was dark enough that he could pee…

As if his body reacted to even the thought of letting go, Dylan felt new heat against his clenched hand. He lurched in the direction of the water, trying to adjust his eyes enough to find a flight of stairs.

Movement while holding was proving to be impossible, and Dylan choked as he felt himself wet more.

Please…he begged silently…just one more minute…

Off to his right, Dylan saw the dim outline of the string lights wound around the railings of one of the stairs. He somehow had both hands between his legs at this point, stumbling recklessly toward the steps. At the last second, he threw out his left hand to grab on to the railing.

The move saved him from hurtling headfirst down the 20 or so steps, but it cost the last thread of control. Dylan whimpered as he tripped unevenly down the stairs, piss streaming down the front of his pants.

He hit the sand at the bottom of the stairs, pitching forward with momentum. It took both hands to keep him from faceplanting, and Dylan was nearly sobbing as he pushed himself upright, dragging his feet to the side of the stairs.

He fumbled with his drenched zipper as he kept fully peeing through his sopping underwear. He managed to pull himself free, but the damage had been done.

Breathing hard, Dylan felt a tear slip down his nose as he finished peeing against the hill of sand. His socks squelched in his shoes as he shifted his feet, and he nearly gagged at the sensation.

He was soaked. He’d wet all the way down the front of himself. In gray slacks (“You can’t wear black to a beach wedding,” Caylee had insisted), there would be no hiding his childish indiscretion from everyone.

Dylan’s knees wobbled as he finally finished pissing. He reached out for the banister and pulled himself around, dropping hard onto the stairs.

The light from the string lights wasn’t bright, but it was more than enough to show the dark wetness spread all down his pants.

He felt sick. Just, what, ten minutes ago? 15? He’d been on top of the world, ready to believe that the girl he loved would move to his city and be with him. Now, he was a toddler. A stupid, drunken child who couldn’t even make it to the bathroom. Not even the bathroom. Couldn’t even hold it long enough to piss outside.

Dylan swallowed hard against the sharp lump in his throat. He felt empty. Worthless. What was he even-

“Hey!”

Dylan’s stomach lurched at the sound of Gina’s gorgeous voice. He hunched forward, wrapping his arm around his knees.

“There you are!” Dylan could hear Gina practically skipping down the steps. She flounced down next to him, one step above, and ruffled a hand through his hair.

“You disappeared!” she chirped, still blissfully unaware of just what an idiot he was.

Dylan felt like he was collapsing in on himself. Like he would crumble into ash before Gina even finished talking, disintegrating under the weight of his humiliation.

“Hey.” Gina’s voice softened a bit, and she stroked his hair. God, he loved when she did that. “Come back to the tent. We missed you.”

The silence from his lack of response thundered in Dylan’s ears. He wanted to keep this from her forever, and he wanted to get it over with.

“…I can’t.”

He’d whispered, but they were far enough from the sounds of the tent that she could hear. Dylan felt Gina’s hand still on the back of his head.

“Dyl, what’s wrong?” Gina’s voice wasn’t quite a whisper, but it was quiet. “Are you OK?”

“I…” Dylan’s voice cracked, and he hated himself for it. Gina had moved her hand to his shoulder, and he felt her thumb moving in gentle circles.

“I had an accident.”

Even to his own ears, his voice sounded representatively broken. This was it. There was no coming back from such a –

“It’s OK.”

Stunned, Dylan looked up before he could stop himself. For half a second, he rued the fact that Gina could now see his surely red-rimmed eyes and the mortifying wetness across his lap.

But Gina looked right into his glazed eyes, her face gentle and sure. She lifted her hand from his shoulder and brushed his hair across his forehead, and he leaned unconsciously into her touch.

“There’s an ocean right over there.” She pointed with her other arm. “And you and I are going to go for an ill-informed yet romantic frolic.”

It took a second for her brilliant plan to sink through Dylan’s alcohol-and-embarrassment-fueled haze, but as soon as it did, he wanted to kiss her.

“Yeah?” was all he managed to choke out.

Gina smiled this time, her eyes crinkling adorably. “Yeah,” she confirmed. “Just a bit, because I would never advocate for fully swimming while drunk, but we couldn’t help ourselves.”

She was pulling Dylan to his feet, and he found himself once again being gently dragged by her soft grip.

“Shoes off,” she ordered just before they reached the surf.

Both shoeless, they stepped into the water, still warm from the day. Gina never let go of his hand, leading him out until she was waist deep, the low waves surging enough to cover all of the existing wetness on Dylan’s pants.

“Your dress,” he murmured, still not quite able to process all that had happened.

Gina reached up and ran her thumb across his lips. He shuddered. “It’ll survive,” she whispered back.

His eyes adjusted to the dark, Dylan gazed down at his gorgeous friend. Friend?

“Thank you.” Not enough, but all he could say right now.

Gina looked up through her eyelashes, smiling slightly. “Ask me to come to Chicago with you.”

Dylan exhaled, the roller coaster of a night apparently not done yet, but he didn’t hesitate.

“Come to Chicago with me,” he breathed. “Please come to Chicago.”

Gina’s eyes sparkled. “I already have an offer. I just didn’t want to take it without knowing we still had a chance.”

Dylan did kiss her now, holding her face in his hands. Gina responded in kind, their chemistry just as perfect as it had been 3 years ago.

Gasping, Dylan pulled back, staring at the magical creature in front of him.

“I…”

He found he couldn’t say anything. He couldn’t even imagine going back to the reception and acting like a normal person. He didn’t know about the human mind overall, but he definitely knew that his mind wasn’t equipped to handle wetting himself at age 25 and then having his dreams come true almost immediately afterwards.

But Gina was still smiling at him, her arms looped around his waist.

“We’ll go back up to the tent when you’re ready,” she promised. “I’ll sneak in and grab our stuff, and then we’ll take the shuttle back to the hotel.” Before Dylan could even quirk an eyebrow, she continued, “We can stand.”

Dylan wanted to kiss her again, but the adrenaline from the past half hour or so abandoned him all at once. He simply leaned forward, gently resting his forehead against Gina’s.

Gina stepped sideways, keeping one arm around Dylan’s waist and letting him rest the side of his head on top of her. They slowly stepped out of the water and toward whatever the rest of the night held.
