Argh, I'm out of upvotes! This was such an excellent story, I loved it! It's so well written, your choice of words and style really matched the story you were telling. A good story is one thing. Good craft is another. And Bray and Dean are just adorable. I want to write the fanfic where they do start dating. If I have one piece of constructive criticism, it's that the London bits and the dialogue with the staff at the hospital could have done with a bit of Brit-picking. Some pretty jarring Americanisms made their way in there. If you ever decide to publish this elsewhere and want a beta reader/brit-picker, please let me know! I'd be happy to do it.

Thanks for creating such wonderful characters and such a sweet and engaging story. Omo or not, this could be published just about anywhere, I think. It was a pleasure to read.

That's so kind!! Oh, my! First of all, you're totally right about the vernacular. It's one of those things that crossed my mind while I was writing, but then I was too lazy to implement. (Plus, I didn't trust myself not to go WAY overboard and just sound ridiculous!) Thank you so much for reading!!
