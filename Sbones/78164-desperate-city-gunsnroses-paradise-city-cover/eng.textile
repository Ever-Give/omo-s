This is my IMO verision of this great song.

Take me down to the desperate city

Where the panties are wet and the girls are needy

Take me home (oh, won't you please take me home)

Take me down to the desperate city

Where the stalls occupied and the girls are needy

Take me home (oh, won't you please take me home)

Just a small leak comin down my feet

It's a hard case that's tough to beat

I'm your charity case so help a girl in need

Hurry up I'm almost out of time

Take me to the end of the line

About to burst or so they say

Ya gotta keep pushin and ignoring the pain

You know it's a trouble when it isn't a game

Ya keep tellin everything's fine

As long as your panties are dry

Take me down to the desperate city

Where the panties are wet and the girls are needy

Oh, won't you please take me home

Take me down to the desperate city

Where the stalls occupied and the girls are needy

Take me home

Stalled on the doorstep by friendly neighbor

Where my keys are can't quite remember

The legs are shaking I'm dying to pee

Won't go outside because people can see

My bladder hurts and begs for relief

Take me down to the desperate city

Where and the girls are pretty

Take me home, yeah yeah

Take me down to the paradise city

Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty

Oh, won't you please take me home, yeah yeah

So far away

So far away

So far away

So far away

My leaky panties been torn apart

I am peeing on the toilet with the noisy sound

All this pleasure need to masturbate hard

Must be losing my mind "is it right?"

I've done it home a million times

Take me down to the desperate city

Where the panties are wet and the girls are needy

Take me home, yeah yeah

Take me down to the paradise city

Where the stalls occupied and the girls are pretty

Oh, won't you please take me home

Take me down to the desperate city

Where the panties are wet and the girls are needy

Take me home, yeah yeah

Take me down to the desperate city

Where the stalls occupied and the girls are pretty

Oh, won't you please take me home

I wanna go, I wanna go

Oh, won't you please take me home

I wanna pee, honey, can't you see

Oh, won't you please take me home

Take me down to the desperate city

Where the panties are wet and the girls are needy

Take me home

Take me down to the desperate city

Where the stalls occupied and the girls are needy

Oh, won't you please take me home

It's coming out, it's pouring out

Oh, won't you please take me home

I wanna see, how much a woman can pee

I want to take you home

Take me down to the desperate city

Where the panties are wet and the girls are needy

Oh, won't you please take me home

I wanna go, I wanna know

Oh, won't you please take me home, yeah baby
