I'm mainly setting this thread up because, since I've been trying to find a particular story for a while, I figured other people might be/have as well.

I'm trying to find a story that takes place at an amusement park of sorts, where the main character eventually pops a squat and wets herself in line for the restroom, and is diapered along with her friends in her group, which she eventually messes on a ride.
