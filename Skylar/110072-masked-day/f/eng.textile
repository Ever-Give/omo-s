Masked Day

Life went on placidly the next few days, at least for Charlotte, cause her ‘little brat’ seemed quite docile these days, I mean, not hovering over Charlotte begging for more of that kinda training or something. As for Ashley, god knows whether she hydrating herself sneakily, no abnormality had been noticed by Charlotte so far, though.

Time slipped away smoothly and it was weekend again. Charlotte went out for a morning jogging as usual, creeping towards Ashley leaving her a soft kiss on her forehead, then out of the room. Meantime Ashley was in her sweet dream slumbering safe and sound, after the kiss she smiled slightly and turned aside, sleeping still. It was a regular jogging, despite Charlotte was wearing a mask due to recent epidemic. It wasn’t that big a deal, but better safe than sorry.

Since Ashley knew Charlotte’s daily jogging, she proposed to prepare both their breakfast as she woke up, sparing Charlotte’s time for buying breakfast elsewhere or making breakfast and which disciplined herself to maintain a healthier schedule as well. However, this time she forgot her responsibility and overslept. So when Charlotte returned to her dorm to seeing Ashley lingering in bed, unconscious. She twist her cheeks gently and woke her up. Ashley mumbled, eyes half-opened

“What’s goin’ on? I ain’t gon’ jog with you, let me sleep a little more… Wait! Had you already finished your exercise?!”

Ashley bounced up with a sudden impulse, eyes fixed at those of Charlotte.

“Ohh… I’m sorry, hon, I overslept.”

It was literally nothing, but staring at that adorably guilty look on Ashley’s face, Charlotte grinned and determined to improvise a tease on this excuse. She cleared her throat and faked a decent voice,

“Well, since you’ve made a mistake, I’ma have to make you compensate for it…”

Ashley froze at the scene, evidently not anticipating such consequences, but she remained a apologetic demeanor,

“What… what will I do to… to compensate it?”

Hearing her voice trembling like this, Charlotte realized she might’ve done too far, so she stopped pretending serious, swiftly shifted her tone and said,

“I got you, didn’t I? Haha, look at you, you little fool. I’m never gonna blame you, sweetheart, of course. Just wanna tease your bladder again, ya ready?”

The tension on Ashley’s face was replaced by a flirtatious annoyance,

“You could’ve just asked! And… I’m ready!”

Soon she washed her face, brushed teeth, and started to prepare their breakfast. Charlotte helped her, and asked,

“Aren’t you going to use the bathroom?”

“Well, I guess that’s what I deserve, for the compensation of my mistake.” Ashley said deliberately.

Actually, the day before, they had agreed to hang out at a pedestrian mall nearby today. So at this moment submitting her release right to this ‘egregious woman’ ahead was purely playing with fire, but she loves the way it burns. Charlotte was surprised at first, but shortly after wore a playful smile,

“Okay if you insist, but from now on, I’ll take control over you.”

“I see.”

Ashley nodded in obedience.

Charlotte kept Ashley hydrated the whole morning, measuring her intake of water to make her uncomfortable yet within control. After the lunch which of course consisted some drinks, Ashley was perceivably uneasy, but the real challenge had just begun. Minutes later, they got changed and ready for the outing today. Charlotte viewed Ashley, who looked staggeringly pretty in her typical uniform-like outfit, mask veiling her blushing cheek driven by the flows she tryna hold on to. Then they set off. 

Their shopping, basically was just window shopping, since both of them weren’t that type of person who fancied luxurious clothes or sumptuous jewels, Charlotte is rather practical while Ashley prefer plain and simple style and in Charlotte’s eyes she looks nice no matter what she wears. Shopping with friends doesn’t mean you gotta buy things, the fun of hanging out isn’t what you do, but who you’re with. Besides, having a n afternoon tea in nearby cafe after walking around for hours is quite refreshing as well——? 

Ashley probably wouldn’t agree. She straightened up to conceal the bulge on her belly, which added even more pressure to her already tortured bladder. She remained an elegant posture, holding Charlotte’s hands, trying not to attract the attention of the passers-by. At the surface, she looked calm and steady, however, underneath the mask her face was burning. Without the help of her legs, her bladder mustered up all its strength to fight it alone. Her under part was extremely sensitive, every step she took rubbed her underwear wetted by her love lotion underneath her skirt. 

Despite this, she was still holding on. Sensation along with libido kept accumulating, and in the effect of the mask, the air Ashley breath grew hotter each time, heating her body every second. Charlotte felt pity at her sweat-oozing forehead and heavier sound of breathing, but also sadistic at the same time. Finally, Ashley leaned to her and murmured faintly, voice trembled for striving to hold it,

“May… may I please release?”

Holding her in arms, staring at her mask, Charlotte grinned and came up with an idea,

“Okay, but with requirements.”

“Wha…what requirements?”

Charlotte didn’t answer at once but led her to the closest public toilet, sneaking into the stall together when no one’s watching.

“Now, don’t take off your pants and let go all your urine on it.”

“But… I can’t go on shopping like this, with this wetted underwear…”

Ashley answered hesitantly, frightened at the thought but excited by the humiliation of peeing herself. That’s when Charlotte’s hands went down to touch her pants and felt the wetted spot,

“Huh? But you’re already wetted, aren’t you, you little cunt?”

Stimulated by her finger while being insulted verbally got Ashley’s red cheeks even hotter,

“I… I’m not…you can’t…”

“Oh, well, if you don’t wanna follow my instruction, then keep on holding it, let’s get out, go.”

Charlotte performed casually.

“You pervert, horrible!”

Ashley was almost driven to tears, starting to shivering while hands clawing scratching Charlotte in protest.

Finally the urge overwhelmed her resistance, and she began to piss through her pants in the bowl. The transparent colorless liquid, which was a firm evidence of over-hydration, soaked Ashley’s white underwear, darkening the cloth’s original color, then when ‘the reservoir’ couldn’t take any more, the uncontrollable current came splashing downwards on the water surface below, triggering untold number of wavelets and dribbles. The cascade lasted for several minutes before Ashley finally emptied her bladder with tremendous capacity and collapsed into the seat, exhausted. Just as she reached out for the door, Charlotte stopped her with a wicked smile on her face.

“Why hurry? Your task hasn't completed yet.”

“I did what you said, what more do you want from me?”

Ashley looked piteous.

“It’s for your own good. You can’t go back there with a wetted underwear. I’m not that cruel, after all.”

She paused a bit to observe Ashley’s reaction, who seemed grateful for her mercy and replied,

“I knew you’re not that harsh, Char.”

She stepped forwards and tried to kiss her, but suddenly thought of something and stopped to ask,

“But where should we put it?”

She nodded sideways.

“Simple answer, hon, the panties of course will go into your mouth. The mask you wear will perfectly conceal it!”

Charlotte showed her cards at last.

“What? You can’t be serious! I’ve never done this before, it’s way too far…”

Ashley retorted.

“Don’t you wanna try? I mean, didn’t you imagine doing this, even for once?”

“Err…Well, I admit I did, but I’m afraid I can’t take it…”

Ashley’s audacity started to fight her ration, and after a short while of Charlotte’s tempting,

“Okay, so be it, I’ll try.”

Ashley took off her damp underwear and squeezed it into her mouth, stuffing her mouth and making her cheeks bulge a bit, then wore her mask back to camouflage it. She looked pretty normal from the outside, while inside savoring the taste of her own medicine. Additionally, she was coerced to drink quite amount of water this morning, some of which hadn’t been into her bladder at that time, so shortly after, her bladder started to refill, torturing her up and down alike. Ashley tried not to suck the urine, but the cloth inside stimulated her tongue to secrete saliva so she had to swallow it at intervals to avoid leaking. 

Each swallow brought her a salty and bitter taste, while also turning her on due to a humiliating psychological implication and her refilling bladder, which aggravated her desire to pee simultaneously. What’s worse, the mask and her pants restricted her breath, suffocating her slowly. It was like a vicious cycle, pushing Ashley to her limit in this infinite hell of torment. It was almost evening when their window shopping was coming to an end. Ashley didn’t really know it was her need to pee or orgasm that was stimulating her anymore. Charlotte saw she was close to broken, so she took her to the closest coffeehouse and ordered two cups of takeaway coffee, then went right to their dorm. Ashley was too lascivious to speak, she barely covered her desire to touch herself until her indecent acts were impeded by Charlotte.

Charlotte quickly finished her drink on the way, carrying the empty cup for Ashley’s grand finale. Soon as they got home, Charlotte announced her last command.

“Now it’s your last task.”

She took Ashley’s underwear out of her mouth then put it into the cup and continued,

“Pour your coffee into this cup and drink it off, do not miss a single drop, suck off what’s soaked into your underwear!”

“Y…yes, master, as your command.”

Ashley was utterly broke, all she could think about was fulfilling Charlotte’s task to earn her release. She poured the coffee into the other cup to drink, and another cup to drink until it was empty, then put the underwear into her mouth and sucked it clean, the mixture of coffee, urine and her saliva was swallowed down her throat, Ashley was finally taken to the bathroom and permitted to release. She let go while moaning:

“Please…I want it…please…uhh… give me…”

Charlotte couldn’t contain at such slutty words. She stripped Ashley and herself off, emptying her own bladder all over Ashley’s body, then turned on the shower, her clit rubbed against hers till they orgasmed together, sweaty bodies intertwining, slimy tongues crossing. As the orgy was over, the shower washed away the turmoil, and the pair relished the lingering feelings.

“What a blast! Thanks SO much you pushed me, Char, or I’ll never know how exhilarating it is.”

“Save it to yourself, Ash. You’re miraculous, courageous, incomparable! I love you, babe.”

Charlotte kissed Ashley on her forehead affectionately.

“Love you, too, mon cher.”

Ashley whispered tenderly.

They went to bed and fell into sleep safe and sound, in dreamland encountering each other.
