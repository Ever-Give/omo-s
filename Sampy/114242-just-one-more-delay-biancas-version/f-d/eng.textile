Author’s Note:

Hi everyone! This is not only my first time posting on here, but also the first story I’ve ever written—and I’m both excited and nervous to share it. This is something I honestly thought I’d never do, but hey, why not give it a go, right? We all have to start somewhere. 🙂

The story is already complete (minus a few final tweaks) and will be posted in 10 chapters, including an intro and an epilogue. I plan to post one chapter per day, though that could change depending on how things go.

I really hope you enjoy reading it, and I’m more than happy to hear your thoughts and feedback as the chaos ensues.

Thanks so much for giving it a chance!

Oh—one more thing: in terms of content warnings, I don’t think there’s anything to worry about. The main focus of the story is exactly what I’ve listed in the tags.

Chapter 1 – “The Calm Before the Game”

The day started early for Bianca. Today was a big one, the final football match of the season, and if her team won, they'd take home the league title. She’d been buzzing with excitement the night before, barely able to sleep as she imagined celebrating with her friends and teammates.

By the time her alarm rang at 7:00 AM, she was groggy but determined. A lack of sleep was nothing an energy drink couldn’t fix. It was the only thing that kept her from feeling like a zombie on mornings like this. And it worked—until the crash came, of course. But that would be later. She’d deal with it when the game was over.

Bianca was a caffeine addict—coffee, energy drinks, you name it—and relied on the buzz to power through her days. Football was more of a passion project than anything serious. Her real job was working part-time at a small local store to scrape together some money, since she never seemed to have enough. She had a shift later today, but right now, all that mattered was the game.

Still exhausted, she lay in bed for ten more minutes, gathering the willpower to move. Eventually, she dragged herself to the bathroom for her usual morning routine: a quick pee, brushing her teeth, and a glance in the mirror. Her long blonde hair was usually tied up in a messy bun, but now, strands were falling loosely around her face, soft against her freckled cheeks. She didn’t mind the mess—today, strength mattered more than perfection.

She couldn’t help but smile at the reflection. She might not be the prettiest or the most polished, but when she stepped onto that field, her strength was undeniable. At five feet four, Bianca wasn’t tall, but her body was strong and fit, her muscles toned from the hours she spent practicing football. She was proud of it, even if she didn’t like to show it off. She’d worked hard for this, even if most people just saw her as ‘the girl on the field.'

She headed back to her room to get dressed. She slipped into her favorite pink thong, which she swore brought her luck, then pulled on a pair of grey sweatpants and a plain black t-shirt. She’d change into her football kit at the field.

Today’s match was an away game—the furthest destination on their schedule—so the team had booked a coach to take them there. It was already 7:30 AM, and pickup was set for 8:00. She chugged the rest of her energy drink, grabbed her gear, and hurried out the door.

At the pickup spot, she met up with the team, especially her two best friends, Keely and Samantha. Knowing Bianca’s love for caffeine, they greeted her with a surprise: a large Starbucks coffee. They hadn’t realized she’d already downed a full 500ml energy drink, but Bianca smiled and took it anyway. She appreciated the gesture—her friends knew she didn’t have much money, and any small gift meant a lot.

The three of them stood sipping their drinks, chatting excitedly about the match, the cool morning air buzzing with anticipation as they waited for the coach to arrive.

Just a quick heads up that I had to wait for content approval before posting again, which is why there was a bit of a delay. But now that I think everything’s good to go, I’ll be continuing the story regularly. Hope you enjoy Chapter 2!

Chapter 2 - "A Ticking Clock"

By 8:00 AM, the team had loaded onto the coach and was heading down the motorway. Excitement buzzed in the air, but the caffeine buzz was doing something else entirely to Bianca. The energy drink she chugged earlier had started to work its way through her system, and the large Starbucks coffee from Keely and Samantha wasn’t helping. She crossed her legs as she sat near the middle of the bus, chatting with her two best friends. She could feel the first signs of pressure building in her bladder.

Samantha and Keely were shifting in their seats too, and it became clear that all three of them were starting to feel it, but Bianca’s situation was just a bit more urgent. The extra 500ml she drank earlier was catching up fast.

By 9:00 AM, Bianca was shifting in her seat, increasingly uncomfortable. She bounced her knee to distract herself, but it wasn’t working. Her bladder, a tight knot from the energy drink and the Starbucks coffee, was starting to protest. She kept crossing and uncrossing her legs, the pressure slightly increasing with each passing minute. Her friends hadn’t yet noticed, too busy talking, but the conversation wasn't her top priority anymore. It felt as though every second that passed was echoing in her mind, reminding her of the urgency of her situation.

Eventually, she whispered to Keely, “I’m gonna check if the bus has a toilet.”

She stood up and made her way down the aisle, steadying herself as the coach rumbled along. At the back of the bus, she found the small bathroom door and tried the handle—locked. A faded piece of paper was taped to it:

Out of Order — Sorry for the inconvenience.

Bianca stared at the sign in disbelief, her bladder gently twinging in protest. She returned to her seat with a slight frown, her pace slower than before.

“No luck,” she muttered, sliding back into her spot.

Keely turned in shock, her brunette hair brushing against the back of her seat. “Seriously?” Keely asked, shifting in her seat.

Samantha looked at her with concern. Samantha leaned forward, her long legs extending across the seat as she pressed her thighs together.

“Great. Three hours and no bathroom. Love that for us.”

Traffic turned the ride into a crawl. They were behind schedule, crawling through construction zones and bottlenecks that made the situation worse by the minute. The coach's air conditioning didn’t help either — the cold made the need even sharper.

By 11:00 AM, Bianca was genuinely struggling. It had been four hours since she last peed, and the combined force of her morning drinks was pushing hard against her bladder. She sat with her arms folded tightly over her stomach, bouncing her knees, her face tense with concentration.

Keely and Samantha weren’t doing much better, both whispering complaints and fidgeting restlessly in their seats. Keely bit her lip, a streak of red lipstick catching on her teeth as she frowned, clearly frustrated. Samantha’s brows furrowed, her piercing green eyes narrowing as she shifted in her seat. A stray lock of black hair fell across her face, her dark eyeliner smudging slightly from the restless motion.

Finally, the driver announced a short emergency stop at a roadside rest area with public toilets. The girls exchanged quick glances, a sense of relief washing over them as they heard the bathroom was nearby. But even as their minds relaxed, their bodies were still fidgeting, twitching with the last remnants of desperate urgency. Their squirming grew more pronounced, the knowledge that relief was moments away only making the wait harder.

As soon as the doors opened, the three girls bolted off the bus, racing toward the restroom building in the distance. But Bianca was moving slower than the other two. She tried to keep up, but her shorter legs and the extra weight in her bladder made it hard to match their pace. Each step jarred her bulging bladder, making her wince.

Keely and Samantha reached the building first, but when they saw the coin-operated doors, they froze. None of them had expected this, and for a moment, panic set in. Frantically, they dug through their purses, each of them trying to find coins, their urgency growing with every second that passed. Every moment they lost felt like an eternity.

Luckily, they found a few coins. They quickly fumbled with the machine, slipping the coins in, but it was slow — too slow. Each coin clinked and fell into the slot with a hollow echo, making their desperation feel all the more real. The machine seemed to mock their frantic pace, rejecting a coin once or twice before finally accepting enough to let them through.

Keely and Samantha slipped inside, both of them fumbling with the door and rushing to find a stall. Their hands shook as they tried to get the stall door open, a mix of frustration and desperation on their faces.

Keely yanked down her football shorts and red panties in one swoop, the urgency in her movements overwhelming as she quickly slid onto the seat, her body instantly relaxing as she began to pee, the sound of relief filling the small space.

Samantha, on the other hand, wasn’t so lucky. She rushed into the stall, pulling up her black skirt and practically throwing herself onto the toilet. But just as she settled in, she glanced down and froze, her breath hitching.

She still had her pantyhose on.

She cursed under her breath, hissing as she had to scramble back up, her bladder aching in protest, just to peel them off. The sound of Keely’s steady stream and moans of relief from the stall next door only made it worse, the contrast between Keely's relief and her own growing desperation painfully clear.

Samantha finally managed to yank off the pantyhose, sighing in relief as she sat back down, her body aching for release. But as she started to pee, a sudden realization hit her — she still had her panties on.

The frustration surged through her, but she couldn’t stop the flow. With no time to waste, she quickly and awkwardly pulled her white cotton panties to the side, praying it would work. The pressure finally began to ease, the sweet relief rushing in as she joined Keely in the moment of release, her body finally giving in after what felt like an eternity.

While the chaos inside the bathroom unfolded, Bianca was dealing with her own brand of panic outside.

Bianca finally arrived at the bathroom, her steps slow and shaky as her bladder screamed for relief. She hurried over, only to be met with the sight of the coin-operated machine blocking the door. Her stomach dropped. She hadn’t known you needed to pay to use the bathroom. Not that she had any change on her anyway — she rarely carried cash, always scraping by with what little she had. Things like paying to pee were luxuries other people took for granted.

She called inside, “Keely! Samantha!”

But the door was shut, and her voice was swallowed by the noise of their own chaos within.

Shifting from foot to foot, she could feel the pressure in her bladder growing unbearable. She looked around, frantic, as every passing second made her urgency worse.

By the time her friends exited the bathroom, freshly relieved, they found Bianca standing outside, bouncing from foot to foot, her face a mixture of frustration and embarrassment.

“I didn’t have any cash,” she muttered, her voice barely audible, trying to hide how miserable she felt.

Keely and Samantha exchanged a glance, their expressions softening as they took in Bianca’s suffering. They could see it in her eyes, how much she'd been holding it in, especially after all those drinks.

Bianca’s voice cracked as she grabbed Keely’s arm, her eyes wide with desperation.

“Please, I need change! Just let me go in, I can’t hold it anymore!”

Keely glanced at the time, her face tight with panic. “We’ve gotta get back on the coach like, now! We’re already running behind.”

Bianca’s heart sank. “It’s not fair,” she pleaded, her voice quivering. “You guys got to pee, and I didn’t. It’s not…”

Before Keely could respond, Samantha spoke up, her voice softer and sympathetic. “She’s right, Keely. It’s not fair. Just a few coins, please.”

Keely’s brow furrowed, but she nodded reluctantly and dug through her purse. Samantha did the same, but after a few seconds of searching, both of them pulled out only crumpled notes.

The machine only accepted coins.

“Shit,” Keely muttered under her breath, glancing at Bianca. “We don’t have any change. Only bills.”

Bianca’s stomach twisted.

“No coins? Are you serious?” she muttered, the frustration and urgency clouding her thoughts.

Keely sighed and shook her head, her hands empty. “I’m sorry, B. There’s nothing we can do. We really have to go.”

With her heart sinking, Bianca nodded in defeat, swallowing back the hot tears of frustration. There was no time left, no other option. The pressure in her bladder was becoming unbearable, but she couldn’t bring herself to argue further.

She followed them back to the bus, legs pressed together, silently praying that she could hold on just a little longer.

Chapter 3 - "A Kickoff to Remember"

The coach finally pulled into the away team’s football ground at 11:30 AM, much later than expected. As the girls grabbed their gear and stepped off the bus, Bianca followed behind them, her movements stiff and awkward. Her bladder had grown visibly swollen, creating a slight bulge beneath her sweatpants, and every step sent an uncomfortable jolt through her lower stomach. She couldn’t run, not without risking something serious, so she settled for a fast-paced hobble.

Then she saw it—the bathroom sign, just across the lot. Her eyes lit up, a flicker of hope breaking through the fog of desperation. Relief was in sight. She quickened her pace, or at least tried to. Each step was a stilted, uneven hobble, her thighs pressed tight together, one arm instinctively bracing her lower abdomen. The distance wasn’t far, but it felt like a marathon. Her heart pounded as she closed in on the door, every nerve in her body screaming for her to move faster. She could almost feel the release already, just seconds away…

“Bianca! Inside the changing room now, we don’t have much time.” The manager’s voice cut through the air like a slap, halting her in her tracks. Her hand hovered just inches from the door handle. For a moment, she didn’t move, like her brain was refusing to register the words. Relief had been so close she could taste it.

“I really need to pee,” she said softly, her voice strained, almost pleading.

The manager looked genuinely apologetic but still firm. “Sorry, but tactics first. We’re already running late. This is important.”

Bianca’s hand dropped from the door handle like it weighed a hundred pounds. Her stomach twisted with frustration, but she didn’t argue. She couldn’t. Swallowing the urge to cry out, she turned away, her jaw clenched so tight it ached. She shuffled back toward the changing room behind Keely and Samantha, her movements even stiffer now, almost robotic. Her body felt like it was screaming in protest with every step. The bathroom had been right there, right there, and now it might as well have been miles away.

Inside the changing room, the manager’s voice droned on, outlining formations and strategies, but Bianca didn’t hear a word. Her attention was fully locked on not losing control. She sat at the edge of the group, subtly trying to hide how badly she was bursting for a piss, hands curled into fists at her sides. Her bladder pulsed with unbearable pressure, every second dragging out longer than the last. No one seemed to notice how tightly she was clenching her legs or the way her face occasionally twitched in discomfort. She didn’t want them to. She just had to hold on a little longer. Just until the talk ended. Just until the match started. Just until there was another chance. But deep down, she knew her chances were running out.

After what felt like forever, the manager finally clapped his hands. “Alright, get changed and be out on the pitch in five.” He turned and stepped out. The room instantly erupted into movement.

Bianca moved slower than the others, her hands trembling slightly as she reached for her kit. Every bend and twist sent another jolt through her overfull bladder, and she had to pause halfway through unzipping her bag just to press her thighs together and breathe. The relief she needed was still only meters away, taunting her through the wall, but now she had no choice but to change.

She started with her black shirt, the easiest piece to remove in her current state. Lifting her arms took some effort, but at least it didn’t press on her bladder. She peeled it off quickly, tossing it into her bag with a sharp exhale through her nose. Even that small motion made her feel more exposed, vulnerable, like her body might betray her at any moment. Just get through this, she thought, clenching her jaw. Get changed, get through the first half, and then you can finally pee.

But even as she tried to change, a deep pressure pulsed in her lower belly—a relentless, full ache that refused to be ignored. Her eyes flicked to the door one last time, wishing she could trade this kit change for just two minutes of relief.

She had to take off her trainers next. But crouching to unlace them sent a jolt of discomfort through her abdomen. She paused halfway, knees bent, body trembling slightly.

This is ridiculous, she thought, gritting her teeth. I’m about to wet myself in a locker room because I can’t even take off my shoes fast enough.

She forced herself to finish, yanking the laces loose and slipping them off with jerky, rushed motions. The moment she stood again, she had to clamp her thighs together and take a sharp breath, bracing herself before moving on.

Next came her sweatpants, easily the worst part. She hesitated for a moment, fingers hooked into the waistband, body tense.

Okay, just get it over with. Down, on, done. You can do this.

She slowly peeled them down past her hips, wincing as the motion forced her bladder to shift and stretch. It felt like her lower belly was made of glass—tight and fragile. She got the waistband to her knees before needing to pause, bent forward slightly with one hand bracing herself on the bench and the other pressing into her thigh.

Don’t lose it. Just don’t lose it.

After a few tense seconds, she shoved them the rest of the way down and stepped out, knees wobbling slightly. Standing there in her underwear, she wrapped her arms around herself for a moment, partly from embarrassment, partly to keep control.

Samantha, half-dressed and crouched by her bag, glanced up just as Bianca peeled off her sweatpants. Her eyes flicked downward, catching sight of the tense curve in Bianca’s lower abdomen.

“Jesus, B,” she said under her breath, standing up and walking over. “Your bladder’s literally showing.” She wasn’t loud, but her voice carried its usual dry bite, softened by genuine concern.

Dressed in a black mesh crop top and matching sports bra, Samantha’s gothic edge was as clear as ever—dark eyeliner, silver rings on her fingers, and black nail polish chipped at the edges. Her skirt and pantyhose lay crumpled on the bench behind her, replaced now by her team shorts and socks.

Bianca managed a breathy laugh, adjusting the waistband of her thong carefully. “You think it’s obvious?”

Samantha arched one dark brow. “Only if someone has eyes. You gonna make it?”

Bianca hesitated, pressing her knees together as she stepped into her shorts. “I don’t know. I really don’t.”

She took a slow breath and looked around the room. “Hey,” she murmured to Samantha, who was pulling her own socks up, “Where’s Keely?”

Samantha glanced up, pushing a strand of black hair behind her ear. “Over there,” she nodded toward the far end of the changing room.

Keely stood tall, surrounded by half the team, gesturing confidently as she laid out some last-minute strategy.

Bianca followed her gaze. “Of course she is,” she said with a faint smile. “How does she always have so much energy? She’s been up since 6 AM, already in her kit, probably memorized the other team’s roster too.”

Samantha chuckled. “She probably dreams in formations.”

That got a laugh from Bianca, soft but real. “Meanwhile I’m over here hoping I don’t pee myself before I finish changing.”

Samantha smirked. “We’re built different. If I had half her drive, I’d be dangerous.”

“Same,” Bianca said, leaning over to unzip her duffel bag. “But honestly, I don’t know how she lives like that. Always on. I’d burn out in a week.”

Samantha gave a shrug, half thoughtful, half amused. “Some people are built for the spotlight. Others are better at surviving in the shadows.”

Bianca looked up at her, touched by the odd poetry in her tone. “And we’re…?”

Samantha smiled. “Comfortably stuck somewhere in the middle.”

They both laughed again, the shared understanding lingering between them for a quiet moment—a sliver of calm before the storm waiting outside.

But the calm shattered in an instant. A sudden, brutal throb surged through Bianca’s abdomen, sharp and deep like her bladder was trying to claw its way out. Her smile vanished. She bent forward slightly, pressing her thighs together hard and clenching every muscle in her lower body.

“Shit…” she hissed under her breath, barely realizing she’d said it aloud.

Samantha looked over in concern, but Bianca kept her eyes on the floor, breathing slow, shallow breaths. Her body was screaming at her to just let go, to give in, to release the unbearable pressure right there on the floor.

And for a terrifying second, she actually considered it. She imagined the warmth, the relief, how good it would feel…

But then reality punched through the fog of desperation. She was at the away ground. If she peed here, on their changing room floor, she’d not only humiliate herself, she’d be fined. A fine she couldn’t afford. Not even close.

“Nope,” she whispered to herself through gritted teeth. “Not here. Not now.”

She forced herself upright, willing the pain back down, even as sweat gathered on her brow and her legs trembled beneath her.

Samantha watched her for a beat, unsure whether to speak. Bianca gave her a weak smile and tried to play it off.

“Guess I’m more of a ‘breaking in the shadows’ kind of girl.”

Bianca forced herself upright, her legs still trembling. Samantha was still watching her, not prying, just present, her eyes a little more serious now beneath her dark eyeliner.

“You alright?” she asked, voice low, just for Bianca.

Bianca nodded, though it was more of a lie than anything else. Samantha didn’t press. Instead, she leaned in slightly and offered her a small smirk.

“If you pass out mid-game, I’m stealing your boots. They’re cooler than mine.”

Bianca let out a breath that was halfway between a laugh and a groan. The tension eased for a second.

“You’re the worst,” she muttered.

“Flattering,” Samantha replied dryly, then added, a bit softer, “You’ve got this. Just hold it together.”

Bianca let out a small laugh, still wincing as her bladder pulsed painfully. She glanced at Samantha, who was standing tall beside her, her long limbs stretching comfortably across the space. Without thinking, Bianca stepped into Samantha’s embrace, needing a moment to just let the pressure fade a bit.

Samantha wrapped her arms around Bianca, her height causing Bianca to nuzzle slightly into Samantha’s chest.

“Feels like you’re practically a foot taller than me,” Bianca mumbled, the humor lightening her mood.

Samantha chuckled softly, the top of Bianca’s head just reaching her collarbone. “Maybe if you had some extra height, you wouldn’t be feeling so cramped right now,” she teased, giving Bianca a little squeeze.

Bianca let out a strained laugh, her small frame almost feeling like it was getting lost in the hug, but the warmth of it brought her a tiny bit of comfort.

Just as the moment of calm settled, their manager’s voice broke through from the other side of the door, calling them to the field.

“Time to leave, girls. The game’s about to start.”

Ready—but barely—she followed the others out of the changing room toward the pitch, casting one last longing glance toward the bathroom she never got to use. Bianca clenched her jaw, doing her best to focus on the game, but her bladder throbbed with every heartbeat. Each step felt like a battle, the pressure building with every second.

She hated how much it consumed her thoughts—how it kept pulling her attention away from the game.

Focus, she told herself. You’re here to play.

But no matter how hard she tried to push it aside, the relentless pressure kept reminding her of its existence. She could feel the weight of it with every movement, like a ticking clock she couldn’t stop.

The game kicked off, but Bianca couldn’t move at her usual speed. Her legs felt stiff, slower than usual, and every twist and turn sent a sharp pulse of discomfort through her abdomen. She hesitated before every sprint, afraid of the sudden jolt that might make things worse.

The other players barely seemed to notice her struggle, pushing forward, speeding past her as if it was just another normal game. But to Bianca, it felt like everything was happening in slow motion. She played hard, of course, but not nearly at the level she was used to. The pressure in her lower stomach was unbearable. She couldn’t stop thinking about how badly she needed to pee.

Just get through the first half, she told herself, willing the game to move faster, the minutes to pass quickly. But they didn’t. Every movement made the sensation more intense. It felt like her body was betraying her—every jolt, every twist, every turn. She hated it. This shouldn’t be happening right now. Why couldn’t she just focus on the game?

Bianca’s breath came quicker, not from exertion, but from the mounting discomfort. Sweat dripped down her forehead, mingling with the sting of frustration. The game raged around her—shouts of encouragement, the whistle of the ref, the pounding of cleats on the grass—but it all felt muffled to Bianca. All she could hear was the sound of her own heartbeat, the throb in her bladder echoing louder with each passing minute.

Focus. Just make it to halftime, she repeated in her head. It was the only thing that kept her going.

By the time the halftime whistle blew, she was soaked in sweat—not just from exertion, but from the effort of holding everything in. The last thing she wanted to do was add more liquid to her already overburdened bladder, but her parched mouth and lightheadedness made it impossible to resist. Her body was begging for a break.

Bianca grabbed a 500ml water bottle and downed it in one long pull, desperate to quench her thirst. She didn’t want to make things worse, but her mouth was dry, and she felt faint from the heat.

As the manager called the team together for the halftime briefing, Bianca’s eyes immediately locked onto the bathroom just across the field. She felt a surge of hope, her bladder begging for relief. She could make it—she knew she could.

Without thinking, she took a tentative step away from the group, her body already in motion, the promise of release so close it almost felt real.

But as if sensing her intent, the manager’s voice stopped her in her tracks.

“You can go in a second, just let me finish this first, alright?”

Bianca froze, her heart sinking. Her stomach twisted, the pressure inside her making her breath hitch.

No. Not again. Please, I can’t wait any longer. Just let me go—please...

Her mind screamed, but her body remained still. She clenched her fists at her sides, fighting to keep herself composed. She could feel the slightest leak starting to form at the base of her bladder, her body threatening to betray her.

I just need a minute...

She gave a quick nod, swallowing hard, and reluctantly turned back toward the group.

The next five minutes felt like a lifetime. She shifted from foot to foot, her thighs clenched tightly together—subtle but desperate movements as she tried to maintain some semblance of composure.

Come on, come on. Just a few more minutes, please...

When no one was looking, she pressed her hands against the waistband of her shorts, the need to hold herself almost overwhelming. She was seconds from losing it. Every second stretched on painfully, her bladder throbbing with each beat of her racing heart.

I can’t hold it much longer. Just let me go!

Finally, the manager gave her the nod.

Yes!

The floodgates were almost open, and her entire body sighed with relief—I’m gonna make it. She wasted no time, practically jogging across the field toward the bathroom building, her legs stiff and strained with each step, feeling the constant threat of an accident as she pushed forward.

But when she got there, her heart sank.

A long queue of girls from the opposing team stretched out the door. The line hadn’t been there moments ago.

Of course. Of course they’re all here now, Bianca thought bitterly, her stomach churning with frustration. Her heart raced even faster now, pounding in her ears.

She joined the back of the line, standing as still as she could, her feet shifting slightly, rocking her body in a subtle rhythm to try and hold on. But it wasn’t helping.

She could feel the full weight of the 500ml water she’d just drunk, sloshing around inside her, hitting her bloated bladder like a freight train. Every second felt like an eternity.

Her stomach tightened with each throb of pressure, her body begging her to give in. She clenched her jaw, desperately trying to hold everything in.

Come on, come on, just a little bit more...

She could feel the sweat trickling down the back of her neck, her bladder pressing against her waistband with agonizing force. Every muscle in her body screamed for release. It had been at least five hours since she last peed. Five hours of pressure building, inching toward the point of no return.

Bianca hesitated for a moment, her nerves making her stomach churn almost as much as the pressure in her bladder. She wasn’t one to ask for favors—especially not from strangers. She could already feel the heat creeping up her neck, the embarrassment threatening to swallow her whole.

But there was no time left for pride.

With every passing second, the pressure was becoming unbearable, and though the idea of asking them to let her cut the line made her stomach twist, she had no choice. Her bladder was about to burst, and she could no longer hide how badly she needed to pee.

“Uh, excuse me,” Bianca finally said, her voice coming out quieter than she intended, but there was no mistaking the urgency in it. “I’ve been holding it for over five hours, and I really can’t wait much longer. Would it be possible for me to go ahead? I’m afraid I’m on the verge of an accident.”

One of the girls in the front glanced at her, then at the others. They all exchanged knowing looks, but no one moved.

Finally, one of the girls shrugged. “Sorry, no can do. We’ve all been waiting. You’re gonna have to wait your turn.”

Bianca’s stomach twisted in frustration, and her face flushed with embarrassment.

Of course, she thought bitterly. No one cares how badly I need to go.

She could feel the pressure building in her abdomen, making it harder to even stand still. Minutes crawled by, each one adding more unbearable pressure. Her body clenched with every second, and she rocked lightly on her feet, doing everything she could not to lose control.

She watched, helpless, as the line barely budged. Bianca’s body was trembling, every muscle in her body screaming for release. She stood at the front of the line, her entire being focused on just one thing: the bathroom door.

“I’m gonna piss myself... I’m gonna piss myself...” she muttered under her breath, voice tight, on the edge of breaking. Her legs squeezed together, hands pressed low on her abdomen. Every second was agony. Her bladder was swollen, painfully full, and she felt as if she might explode at any moment.

She was so lost in the chaotic dance of her desperation that when the referee’s whistle pierced the air—loud and sudden—it startled her to her core. The shock was enough to send a big spurt of urine flooding into her panties.

Bianca froze, her breath catching in her throat as a few drops trickled down her legs. For a split second, she felt a strange, sickening sense of relief—like heaven, like everything was finally going to be okay.

But just as quickly, reality hit. She gasped, her eyes wide with horror, and all at once she realized: she was starting to piss herself.

With every ounce of strength she had left, she clenched hard. She clenched her muscles so tight, her insides screamed in protest. The relief stopped—but only just in time.

Her shorts were dark, so the wet spot wasn’t visible, but her panties—her pink thong—were soaked through.

No... no... she thought desperately, biting her lip to keep from whimpering. I can’t... I can't do this...

The intense sensation of holding herself back was overwhelming, but she pushed through it. Blinking back tears of frustration and disbelief that she had sweet relief snatched away once again, she hobbled back toward the field a few unsteady steps at a time, every movement sending waves of pressure through her lower stomach.

God, I just wish I could let out another spurt... she thought, longing for that fleeting sense of relief again—even if it meant a little accident. Anything. But she had to keep going, had to keep it together.

She gritted her teeth and fought it, knowing how close she was to crossing the line.

The rest of the game would be torture.

The score was tied at 1–1, and the second half was everything—not only to win the game, but for Bianca, it was now a battle against her own body. Her bladder felt like it could burst at any moment, and every movement became a careful calculation. She was hunched over slightly, her hands clutching her stomach as though trying to keep everything in place, every step taken with a wince.

The desperation was evident in every feature of her face: her lips pressed tight, her brow furrowed in concentration, her eyes flickering with anxiety whenever she wasn’t focusing on the ball. Her body was physically tense, as if every muscle was bracing for what felt inevitable. Every second felt like a countdown, the pressure building with each tick of the clock. She didn’t know how much longer she could keep it together.

She was torn between two battles—her bladder, screaming for relief, and the game, where the pressure to perform weighed heavily on her shoulders. Every time she tried to focus, her bladder seemed to make its presence known with a sharp pulse that rattled her concentration.

Keely, ever the leader, won the ball in a crucial moment. Her eyes quickly found Bianca, and without hesitation, she passed the ball in her direction—a pass that would’ve been a simple play on any other day.

But today, everything felt wrong.

Bianca’s legs were stiff as she sprinted toward it, her body refusing to obey her normal rhythm. When the ball arrived at her feet, she fumbled, unable to control it as cleanly as she normally would. The pressure was unbearable. She could feel the sweat on her brow and her stomach tightening with each desperate breath. It took longer than it should have for Bianca to settle the ball, and by the time she did, she saw an opposing player charging toward her.

Normally, Bianca would’ve used her quickness—a step to the side, maybe a little shimmy to get around the defender. But not today. The opposing player was a wall of muscle, and Bianca, short and frail in comparison, didn’t want to risk a collision.

Panic and desperation flooded her. With a shaky touch, she backed off, trying to avoid the confrontation, but in doing so, she lost possession of the ball. Before she could recover, the other team pounced. The ball was passed upfield with speed, and a striker lined up a shot that sent it screaming past the keeper.

2–1.

Bianca felt a flush of guilt wash over her, but she couldn’t shake the overwhelming sensation in her bladder—the way it screamed for attention every time she moved. She wasn’t just letting down her team. She was letting herself down.

The silence that followed the goal was suffocating. Keely, normally the ever-optimistic leader, was anything but that. Her face twisted in frustration, and she marched straight toward Bianca, her chest heaving with anger.

"Bianca!" Keely snapped, her voice sharp. "What was that? You had the ball, you had the space! How could you give it away like that?"

Bianca flinched, her shoulders tensing as if she’d been physically struck. The weight of Keely’s anger felt like another blow on top of everything else. She opened her mouth, ready to apologize, but the words stuck in her throat. The pain in her stomach surged, and her bladder pulsed with a deep ache, making it impossible to focus on anything but the shame she felt.

Before she could say anything, Samantha stepped forward, placing a hand gently on Keely’s shoulder.

“Keely, chill,” she said, her voice calm but firm—a stark contrast to the intensity radiating from the captain. "I get it. You’re frustrated. We all are. But yelling at Bianca isn’t gonna help. We’re a team.”

Keely’s expression softened slightly, though the fire in her eyes didn’t entirely fade. Samantha’s tone shifted as she turned to Bianca, her hand now resting on her arm, grounding her in the moment.

“Bianca, listen to me,” Samantha said, her voice steady and reassuring. “I know it’s rough. I know you’re in a tough spot right now, and I can’t imagine how hard it must be to play when you’re holding all that in. Don’t feel guilty about the goal. You’ve been giving it your all, and that’s all we can ask of you. We’ll get back in the game.”

Bianca’s eyes flickered with gratitude, though the tightness in her chest didn’t fully ease. She felt weak, drained, but Samantha’s words hit their mark. Bianca gave a small nod, though she still felt a sinking pit in her stomach. The game was slipping away, and she didn’t know if she could hold on much longer.

Samantha then turned her attention to Keely, her voice quiet but commanding—the peacemaker they both needed.

"Keely, there’s still time. We’re down, yes, but that doesn’t mean it’s over. You’ve got a hell of a team, and we’ll fight until the last whistle. So calm down and focus. We need you.”

Keely exhaled sharply, her anger not entirely gone, but her resolve returning. She gave a curt nod, barely meeting Bianca’s gaze.

"Fine," she muttered. "Let’s just get back to work."

As Keely turned away, Samantha stayed beside Bianca for a moment longer, offering a silent, understanding look. Bianca wanted to speak, wanted to thank her, but the words were locked inside her. Instead, she just gave a faint smile—one that spoke volumes of the silent gratitude she felt.

The game was slipping through their fingers, and every minute felt like an eternity.

Keely, fired up by the urgency of the situation, was giving everything she had to push her team forward. She moved like a force of nature, the ball glued to her feet as she weaved through the opposition, always looking for the perfect opportunity.

Then, at the exact moment they needed it, Keely won the ball in a crucial spot near the midfield and spotted Bianca up ahead. Without hesitation, she played a perfectly timed pass toward her.

Bianca’s heart skipped a beat. It was her moment—yet everything felt so much harder than it had before. Her body was crying out for relief, but there was no time for that now. She forced herself to focus on the ball, blocking out the burning pressure in her lower belly.

The ball bobbled in front of her, and for a moment, she thought she was going to lose control of it again, just like last time.

But no. Not this time.

She gained possession with a quick move, her feet working faster than her mind could process. The defender from the opposing team was charging toward her again—that massive player from earlier. It felt like déjà vu. The same looming figure. The same sinking feeling in her chest.

Bianca knew this was the moment she had to break the cycle. She couldn’t back down now.

With every ounce of strength she could summon, Bianca pushed herself forward—the image of her teammates and the thought of Keely’s disappointed face driving her. She dodged to the right, trying to sidestep the defender, but the woman was too quick. As she reached for the ball, the defender launched herself into a tackle.

Time seemed to slow as Bianca was swept off her feet, crashing hard into the ground. The impact was brutal, and her entire body jolted. Her lower stomach hit the grass with a sickening thud, and a white-hot wave of agony shot through her.

Bianca gasped in pain, the pressure on her bladder overwhelming.

“Aaaagh!” she screamed, the pain twisting her insides.

In that instant, her bladder betrayed her. A gush of warm urine leaked out uncontrollably, soaking her shorts and sending a wave of humiliation and relief flooding through her. But as the pain subsided slightly, something strange happened.

The referee blew his whistle, and to Bianca’s surprise, he pointed to the penalty spot.

“Penalty!” he shouted.

The field erupted in noise. Her teammates cheered, some rushing toward her to lift her up, but Bianca could barely feel their touches. Her hands instinctively shot to her crotch, trying in vain to stop the flow, but the damage had been done. She could feel the dampness clinging to her skin—her shorts and panties soaked with the evidence of her desperation.

Keely, seeing the penalty awarded, jogged up confidently to take the kick. As the captain, she was the first to step up in moments like this. She placed the ball on the spot with determination, then turned to Bianca, giving her a quick nod.

It was a nod of approval, not anger. The kind of silent reassurance that only Keely could give in moments like this.

Bianca couldn’t help but feel a flicker of relief, despite the throbbing pain in her bladder. She watched as Keely took her step back, then ran forward, her foot connecting with the ball in one swift motion.

The ball rocketed toward the top corner of the net, out of the goalkeeper’s reach.

“Goal!” the referee shouted, and the entire team exploded in celebration.

Bianca didn’t move, still clutching herself between her legs, her body trembling with the aftermath of the tackle, but she couldn’t help but smile as she saw her teammates pour toward Keely in celebration. The score was now 2–2.

Keely jogged over to Bianca, wiping the sweat from her brow. Her usual fiery expression softened into something that was almost a smile.

She gave Bianca a quick, approving nod, then murmured, “Nice work, Bianca. You’re doing your best out there. Don’t worry about it.”

It wasn’t much, but for Bianca, it meant everything. The relief that washed over her wasn’t just from the goal, but from knowing Keely wasn’t mad anymore.

But Bianca’s body still ached, and despite the goal, the game was far from over. There was still more work to be done.

As the match drew to a close, Bianca grew weaker. Her body was on the edge, her hands cradling her lower belly with every agonizing step, wincing after each sprint. With just five minutes left, the score was tied at 2–2, and the pressure—both internal and external—had never been more suffocating.

Then, it happened.

Samantha sent a perfect pass her way, and Bianca found herself in the perfect position to score. This was their last real chance, and she knew it. Every muscle in her body screamed, but she gritted her teeth, willing herself to push through.

She drew her foot back, focusing all her remaining energy on the shot.

Just as her leg swung forward, a sharp spasm shot through her, and a warm trickle escaped into her underwear. She gasped, her eyes widening in panic—but there was no time to focus on that now.

The ball soared through the air and hit the back of the net.

3–2.

The crowd erupted into deafening cheers, her teammates crashing into her with excitement. Keely and Samantha were the first to rush over, wrapping her in tight, joyous hugs. The others soon joined in, chanting her name, celebrating their league-winning goal.

But Bianca couldn't feel the joy. Each embrace made her bladder scream louder, each cheer felt like a ticking clock, counting down the seconds before her body gave in. She trembled, her body shaking from the pressure, her legs weak, and her grip on control slipping.

All she wanted was to collapse and release the flood inside her, but she held on, her willpower hanging by the thinnest of threads.

Once the celebrations died down, Bianca broke free from the group, her legs shaking beneath her. She made her way toward the bathroom, every movement slow and deliberate, as if each step took a monumental effort. Her body was fully hunched now, one hand pressed firmly between her legs, desperately trying to hold it together. Every step was a struggle—measured, tense, and painful.

She finally reached the bathroom door and grabbed the handle with trembling fingers, but it didn’t budge.

Her heart skipped a beat. She yanked again. Nothing. A sign hung crookedly over the door:

Closed for Cleaning.

Bianca stood there in stunned silence, her eyes wide with disbelief, her jaw tight with frustration. It couldn’t be real. This couldn’t be happening.

She let out a slow, pained breath, her chest rising and falling as she tried to hold it in, but the pressure was unbearable. She looked around helplessly, then turned away—every muscle in her body screaming for relief.

Defeated, she hobbled back toward the bus, bladder still painfully full, no escape in sight, and no relief to be found.

Just a quick note, sorry for the slightly longer wait for the next chapter, i've been busy, but anyway here it is. Thanks for your patience.

Chapter 4 – "The Road to Relief"

The bus was back on the road again by 1:30 PM, beginning the long three-hour return trip to their hometown. For most of the team, the victory buzz still lingered in the air, and a few of the girls were already dozing off in their seats or chatting about the win.

But for Bianca, the only thing on her mind was the intense, growing discomfort in her lower abdomen. Her bladder hadn’t emptied since her morning pee at 7 a.m., and now, after hours of pressure and missed chances, she was trapped again—no toilet in sight.

She sat with her legs tightly crossed, hands pressed hard into her lap, her face pale with tension. Every bump in the road sent ripples through her body, forcing her to shift constantly just to avoid a leak.

By 2:30 PM—only an hour into the ride—the pain had deepened into something almost unbearable. Her lower belly was visibly swollen, a rounded curve pressing against her waistband, every breath shallow and careful.

Finally, unable to stand it anymore, Bianca rose shakily from her seat and staggered toward the front of the bus, one hand gripping seatbacks for support. Her steps were stiff, deliberate, each one a silent plea for control.

Keely and Samantha both noticed instantly. They exchanged surprised, concerned glances. Bianca never made a scene. For her to get up and ask the driver for anything meant it had to be serious.

They watched in silence as she leaned in to speak to the driver. They couldn’t hear what she said, but her expression when she returned told them everything.

“He’s not pulling over,” Bianca whispered, collapsing back into her seat, her thighs locked together. “I’m gonna pee myself.”

That was all Keely needed.

“What?” she said, standing abruptly. She stormed up the aisle. “My friend hasn’t gone to the bathroom since seven this morning—it’s now two-thirty. She’s in real pain. You have to stop.”

She didn’t let up, layering in urgency and a few pointed remarks until the driver finally relented with a frustrated sigh.

Five minutes later, the bus pulled onto a quiet country lane, bordered by hedgerows and scattered trees.

Keely returned to her seat, triumphant. “See? I got you.”

Bianca gave her a faint smile, but it was clear she was barely holding it together.

The bus doors opened, and six girls immediately stepped out to take advantage of the break. Most jogged off ahead, giggling and chatting as they disappeared behind the shrubs.

Bianca followed behind at a slow, hobbling pace, one hand pressed tightly to her lower stomach, her breathing shallow and focused.

She reached a somewhat hidden spot off the road and fumbled to untie her joggers, her fingers trembling. Every movement had to be slow, careful—any wrong motion and she knew she’d lose it right there.

She lowered them, along with her slightly damp pink thong, and crouched low. At last, after nearly eight agonizing hours, she was ready to pee.

Only… nothing happened.

Bianca whimpered softly in disbelief. Her muscles were locked, clenched so tightly they refused to let go. The pain was dizzying—so sharp it was like her body didn’t know how to stop bracing.

Maybe it was the chill in the air. Maybe it was knowing the other girls were nearby. Maybe it was just her nerves.

She closed her eyes, trying to breathe through it. Slowly, she coaxed herself to relax.

Then, finally, a tiny trickle started. Barely a stream—just a cautious escape, like her bladder was asking for permission.

By now, the other girls were already walking back toward the bus. Bianca had barely begun.

Then, without warning, her body surrendered.

A forceful rush burst out of her, hitting the pavement with a loud splash and even spraying across the narrow road. The relief was so powerful that her whole body sagged in the squat, a moan slipping out before she could stop it. Her mouth hung open slightly, eyes fluttering. She hadn’t realized how much tension she’d been holding until it finally started to leave her.

But the moment was short-lived.

The blare of the bus horn shattered the stillness.

Bianca flinched violently. The driver was honking—urging her to hurry.

Instinctively, she slammed her muscles shut again with a gasp. The pain of cutting off mid-stream was searing.

Shaking, she yanked up her joggers and underwear, her body still trembling from the jolt. She hadn’t even managed to go properly—maybe a few seconds, a drop in the ocean.

Her stomach remained distended and tight, a rock-hard pressure pulsing beneath her waistband as she limped back to the bus.

Keely and Samantha both looked stricken when she returned.

“You didn’t pee, did you?” Keely asked quietly.

“I… I tried,” Bianca whispered as she sat down slowly, every movement strained. “It wouldn’t start at first. Then it did, but he honked… and I had to stop. I’m still… bursting.”

Samantha gently rested a hand on her shoulder. “Poor thing. That’s brutal.”

There was still nearly an hour left on the ride.

Bianca leaned back, completely spent. Her energy was gone—sapped by the game, the heat, the caffeine waering off, and the enormous volume of liquid still trapped inside her.

She curled up in her seat as best she could, legs drawn tight under her, hands resting gently on her aching belly. Her bladder still screamed for attention, but her mind—overloaded and defeated—began to drift.

Even in sleep, the pressure followed her, pulsing through her dreams like a drumbeat. But at least for now, she didn’t have to fight it anymore.

*006*2025-07-29 01:48

Chapter 5 – "Just a Little Further"

The bus gently rumbled to a stop at the station, the hydraulic hiss of the brakes barely rousing Bianca from her sleep. A soft hand touched her shoulder—Keely—followed by Samantha’s gentle voice coaxing her back to reality.

“Bianca… hey, we’re here,” Keely said softly.

Bianca stirred, her eyelids fluttering open slowly. But what greeted her wasn’t a groggy, peaceful transition—it was blinding, stomach-churning pain. A wave of raw pressure pulsed in her lower abdomen, so sudden and sharp she gasped aloud.

Her bladder, having relaxed slightly in sleep, had ballooned alarmingly. It felt as if it had doubled in size. She instinctively hunched over, her legs trembling as she tried to get up.

The moment she moved to stand, a violent pulse surged through her pelvic floor. A hot spurt escaped into her panties. She whimpered, clenching every muscle she could, but the pain was too much.

Keely and Samantha exchanged concerned looks and immediately jumped in to help, each supporting one side of their desperate friend.

“I’ve got you,” Samantha whispered, looping Bianca’s arm over her shoulder.

“Just a little more. You’re so close,” Keely encouraged.

But every step was torture. Bianca’s face was pale, her jaw clenched so tightly it trembled. She dug her nails into her friends’ arms, not out of malice, but sheer survival. Her knees buckled more than once during the ten-minute walk to her house, and more than once, she had to stop—crossing her legs and rocking on the spot while biting back a sob.

The second they reached her front porch, Keely smiled sympathetically.

“We’d stay, but we kind of need to pee again.”

“Text us later, okay?” Samantha added, dancing slightly on the spot.

Bianca nodded, managing a weak smile, and they turned to go.

She was finally home.

And her body knew it.

As soon as she closed the door behind her, the most overwhelming surge of desperation hit her like a freight train. Her bladder, aware relief was mere feet away, screamed to release everything all at once.

She doubled over, both hands crammed between her legs, limping toward the bathroom in slow, painful steps. Every second felt like a fight to keep from wetting herself right there in the hallway.

She reached the bathroom door. The sound that met her ears nearly made her collapse.

Running water.

The shower was on.

Locked.

Her brother was inside.

“No… no no no no!” she gasped, banging her fist on the door. “Please, please, let me in! I’m gonna pee myself! PLEASE!”

She shouted. Sobbed. Banged again. But nothing.

The water drowned out her cries. Her brother had no idea what was happening on the other side of the door.

And he wouldn’t until it was far, far too late.

She looked to the clock through watery eyes. 5:21 PM.

She did the math instinctively: her last pee had been over ten hours ago. Her body was beyond normal limits.

Her lower belly jutted outward, round and firm like a basketball beneath her shirt, pulsing like it had a heartbeat of its own.

Then it hit her. Work.

She had to be there by six.

Panic and urgency overtook her. She spun on her heel and hobbled out the door, not even caring anymore how ridiculous she looked.

“I can pee at work. I just have to make it. Just thirty minutes. Thirty.”

She got in her car, fumbled with the keys, sat down—

—and immediately yelped as the pressure doubled.

Sitting compressed her bladder even more. She squirmed violently, her thighs clenched, her heel digging into the floorboard for leverage.

Halfway through the drive, a red light stopped her.

And then she saw it.

A McDonald’s cup.

Small. Maybe 200ml at best.

She stared at it like it was a divine miracle and a sick joke all at once. It was useless. Insultingly small. But…

“200ml less in me… is still 200ml less,” she muttered, voice shaking.

Without another thought, she yanked her sweatpants down, shakily grabbed the cup, and awkwardly lifted herself off the seat just enough to get into position. Her whole body trembled.

And then—

A trickle.

A sputtering hiss.

Then suddenly, an explosive jet of piss shot from her, so strong it nearly knocked the cup from her hands.

The sharp hiss filled the car, echoing in the enclosed space.

Her eyes fluttered shut, head tipping back in bliss. The relief was electric. She could actually see her stream through the cup’s clear plastic—thick, golden, desperate.

But it was over far too soon.

The cup was full in seconds.

Bianca screamed silently, slamming her pelvic muscles shut again with everything she had left. Her whole lower body convulsed. She had to use the empty McDonald’s bag to keep the cup from spilling, shoving it between her thighs as she struggled to hold the remaining 1.8 liters still inside her.

Her urethra burned.

Her abdomen quivered.

Her foot hovered over the gas, barely remembering how to drive.

But somehow, she made it to work.

Limping.

Shaking.

On the edge.

Still holding.

Her bladder hadn’t burst.

Yet.

Great story!

I like it that Bianca didn’t get a chance to pee for so extreme long.

I like the imagination that she was standing in front of the toilet with her bladder very full, she had no coins and that she had to go back to the bus with her full bladder and a strong urge to pee.

She pleaded “ That’s not fair, you guys got to pee but i didn’t.”

I love the imagination how some drops of wee running down on her bare thighs and wets her knee socks a little bit on top.

Very good written!! I love how you describe her need to pee, her strong urge and how she is fighting for so long to hold her pee back in her bursting full bladder.

Thanks, like I said this is my first time writing so to hear that you enjoy it makes me happy. And don't worry this story isn't ending just yet... 😊

Chapter 6 – "Karen's Game"

Bianca hobbled her way into the shop, practically dragging herself behind the counter. Her bladder was throbbing like a second heartbeat, every step jarring the overfilled organ pressing hard into her pelvis. She didn’t care anymore. She had made it through the drive, had relieved just enough into that tiny McDonald’s cup to survive the journey, but now she was here, and the bathroom was right there. Just ten steps.

She limped toward it, each movement slow and careful. Her entire lower abdomen was like a solid block of pressure. But just before her hand touched the bathroom door, she was met face-to-face with her boss.

“I’m heading out, Bianca,” Karen said bluntly, keys in hand, her purse slung over her shoulder. “You’re on your own tonight. No leaving the counter, got it? If no one’s here, customers can steal.”

Bianca’s mouth opened, but she could barely form words. “I haven’t peed in eleven hours... I really..."

But Karen was already brushing past her and out the door, muttering something about being in a rush.

Bianca stared at the closed door for a second, shaking slightly. Her body wanted to break down and cry, but she knew she was alone now. She turned back to the bathroom door and decided, screw it. No one was here yet.

She yanked down her sweatpants in one desperate move, barely registering the cold air hitting her soaked pink thong. It was clinging to her, uncomfortably damp and useless. Her so-called lucky pair had done nothing but bring her pain all day.

“So much for being lucky,” she muttered.

But before she could even think about relaxing, the doorbell above the shop’s entrance jingled, and a voice rang out.

“Hi, do you have a bathroom I could use? I haven’t peed in like, 30 minutes.”

Bianca felt like her soul left her body. She quickly pulled her pants back up, forcing her screaming bladder to compress as she limped to the counter, a polite expression barely held on her face.

“Yes, just over there,” she said, gesturing toward the very bathroom she’d been about to use herself. Thirty minutes? Thirty minutes?

“Try eleven fucking hours, bitch,” Bianca thought darkly, but kept her smile.

The next thirty minutes were absolute hell. One by one, people walked in—not to buy anything, not to ask questions, but just to pee. Each time Bianca tried to make a move for the bathroom, the door would swing open again. It was like the universe had it out for her. She’d shuffle forward slightly, feel the hopeful twitch in her bladder, and then—jingle. Someone else. Another visitor. Another missed chance.

She took small sips of water from her bottle throughout, trying to stay hydrated, though it felt like pouring lava into a glass already on the verge of cracking. Every swallow of liquid was like a dagger plunging into her lower abdomen, twisting mercilessly. Her bladder was now stretched far past what felt like human limits. The pressure was pushing so hard against her skin it looked like her lower belly had grown a solid curve, taut and trembling under the fabric of her shirt.

By 7:00 PM, the store was quiet. Finally. Bianca looked around cautiously. No one. She stared at the bathroom again, eyes filled with both hope and disbelief that the cycle had ended. She waited.

One minute.

Two.

Five.

No one.

This was it.

She stepped forward, slowly, each step a calculated risk. Her thighs were pressed tight together, her hand grazing her stomach like it could physically hold things in. Her mind wandered, imagining the pure, blissful feeling of release. Just five seconds of that golden, gushing stream and she’d be reborn.

The door suddenly flung open with a loud jingle, making her physically jolt. She whimpered as a spurt escaped, soaking her already damp panties further. Her eyes widened. Her boss was back.

“Hey boss, while you’re here, can I just...” she started, but Karen walked right past her and into the bathroom without a word.

Bianca watched the door shut, her whole body trembling. She could hear it. The sound of the stream hitting the porcelain. It was like torture.

“Karen!” Bianca cried out, calling her boss by her first name for the first time ever.

Karen came out of the bathroom a few moments later, eyebrows raised. “What, young lady?”

Bianca, still hunched over, her voice trembling, practically sobbed, “Please let me pee. You don’t understand, I haven’t gone since seven this morning. I’m in so much pain.”

“Ohh, that’s what this is?” Karen said with a smirk. “I thought you were pregnant or something.”

Karen had a glint in her eye. One Bianca hadn’t seen before. In truth, Karen was absolutely loving this. Seeing Bianca squirm, whimper, beg to pee—it lit something up inside her. Her own arousal built quietly, watching Bianca’s body twist and suffer.

Before Bianca could plead further, the door jingled again. Then again. And again. It was 8:00 PM. The start of the final, busiest hour of her shift.

Karen leaned on the counter. “I wanna see how you handle a rush,” she said, clearly not going anywhere.

“Please, take over just for a minute, I’ll even take half pay, just please let me pee,” Bianca begged in a whisper, desperate not to alert the queue forming in front of her.

Karen’s smile widened. “I’ll pay you triple if you hold it.”

Bianca looked at her in disbelief. “You love this, don’t you?”

Karen gave no answer, only turned to leave. “I only came back to pee. Good luck,” she said, giving Bianca’s swollen bladder a light, teasing prod with her finger before walking out.

“EeEEeUUUUGGgGhhhHH,” Bianca groaned under her breath, almost collapsing behind the counter. It felt like someone had driven a nail straight into her bladder.

The next hour dragged on like a fever dream. Customer after customer came through. Every step, every turn, every stretch across the counter made her see stars. She clenched, whimpered, even had to hold onto the counter for balance.

At one point, a customer dropped their receipt and asked her to pick it up. Bending down sent a violent jolt through her bladder and a leak she knew left a visible wet patch on her pants. She turned and pressed her back to the counter to hide it.

At 8:47 PM, a small group of customers lingered, asking long questions, slow to pay, slow to leave. Bianca stood behind the register, her hands gripping it so hard her knuckles turned white. Her whole body was shaking. Her breath was shallow.

Her bladder was beyond full—an overinflated balloon pulsing inside her, demanding release with every heartbeat.

And still, she held.

Nine o’clock was close.

So close.

But she was reaching the breaking point.

*011*2025-07-31 02:52

Chapter 7 – “Checkmate”

Nine o’clock hit, and she didn’t even bother turning the store sign to “closed.” Her legs were barely functioning, and she could hardly breathe without feeling pressure in her bladder. She didn’t even say goodbye to the last customer—just waited for them to leave, practically shaking as she hobbled toward the bathroom door.

She was going to piss. She was finally going to piss.

Tears blurred her vision again as her hand reached for the bathroom light, already tugging at the waistband of her sweatpants, her whole body screaming in anticipation.

But when she flipped the switch—nothing. No light. No sound. And when she pulled the door open, the sink was taped off, and a note was stuck to the mirror with a piece of cheap masking tape:

“Water’s off, forgot to mention! Plumber coming tomorrow morning. – Karen :)”

Bianca stared at the note like it was written in another language.

No.

No, no, no.

Her eyes scanned the bathroom. The toilet was bone dry, the tank lid removed, and the handle disconnected. She walked over, lifted the seat just to make sure, then pressed her hand into her crotch like it would somehow undo the reality she was facing. There was no plumbing. Karen had turned off the entire water line before leaving.

Bianca’s only bathroom in reach was just a ceramic chair now.

She stood there, mouth open, trying not to scream. Her vision pulsed with the agony in her abdomen. It was like her bladder had grown into its own organ, thudding and pulsing in her lower belly like it had a heartbeat.

It wasn’t pressure anymore—it was pain. A heavy pulse squeezed inside her and she had to double over, crossing one leg tightly over the other and grinding her thighs together just to stop the leak that was already trying to escape.

“F-fucking bitch,” she muttered, biting her lower lip as her body threatened to betray her on the spot.

She backed out of the useless bathroom, leaning on the doorframe, trying to think.

What now?

What the fuck now?

There was a gas station about 20 minutes away by car, and her house was 30. Both felt like they were on another planet. But she couldn’t pee here.

Bianca took a deep breath, grabbed her keys from under the counter, and limped toward the door, waddling like a duck with both hands buried between her legs. She got into her car and sat there for a minute, gripping the steering wheel so tightly her knuckles went white.

Her bladder throbbed up into her stomach, and for a second she felt like she was going to throw up.

“I’m going to kill her,” she whispered to herself. “I’m literally going to fucking kill her.”

But right now, all she could do was try to get home without pissing herself in her seat.

Bianca sat there in her car, legs shaking, seatbelt clicked as she debated between home and the gas station. It was closer—twenty minutes instead of thirty. Ten fewer minutes of pain. Ten fewer minutes where her urethra might just give up and let it all pour out.

She didn’t even turn on the radio. The vibrations would’ve been too much. Everything inside her was focused on keeping it together.

By the time she hit the main road, she was sweating again. She had one hand on the wheel, the other shoved hard between her legs, clutching herself through her sweatpants. She didn’t even care if anyone saw. Her eyes were glassy, lips pressed into a thin line as she whispered over and over, “Almost there, almost there, just hold it, just hold it…”

But of course, things never went that smoothly.

As she approached an intersection just ten minutes from the gas station, her headlights hit something odd. A car had skidded into the sidewalk, halfway up a curb with the hazard lights flashing. The driver was standing nearby waving their arms.

Bianca slowed instinctively, heart pounding, her thighs trembling as she leaned forward, bladder crushed into the seatbelt. The guy looked young, maybe early twenties, and when she rolled down the window a crack, he jogged over.

“Hey, sorry, I wouldn’t ask, but my phone died and I can’t move the car. Can you just call a tow truck for me?”

Bianca’s mouth opened, then closed. She could barely think. She couldn’t even uncross her legs.

“I… I really can’t, I’m kind of in a situation…”

“Please,” he said, desperate. “Just two minutes, I’ve been out here for half an hour. I just need someone to call it in.”

Bianca nearly screamed. She could barely hold in a river of boiling piss and now this guy wanted her to be a good samaritan?

But she couldn’t ignore him. If someone had a phone in their hand and drove past her stranded at night, she’d be pissed too.

She groaned, pulled over slowly, then opened the passenger window and handed her phone out instead.

“Here, just make it quick,” she said, voice tight, face flushed red.

The movement to reach for her phone had sent a sharp jolt through her bladder and her pussy clenched so violently it felt like a muscle tear. She squeezed her thighs together like a vice and let out a shaky breath as he made the call. He stood right outside the car, oblivious to the fact that she was just seconds away from flooding her seat.

Bianca closed her eyes. She imagined the gas station. The bathroom. The door closing. Her pulling down her sweatpants and sitting. Letting it all go.

The fantasy felt so real, she almost didn’t notice the small leak that had escaped. She yelped softly and shifted, grinding down onto the seat, using the pressure of the cushion to clamp off the leak before it could turn into a stream.

The guy handed her phone back, thanked her, and walked off with a wave.

Bianca didn’t even respond. She just peeled away from the curb, one hand shaking, her crotch warm and damp. She’d sacrificed at least one spurt of piss for that guy. It didn’t feel worth it.

The gas station lights were finally coming into view. But her bladder was doing more than throbbing now. It was pulsing, sending waves of pain and heat through her belly and thighs.

One red light away. Just one more.

And that’s when she saw it.

A cop car. Parked right in front of the station entrance.

She couldn’t just leap out of the car and run inside grabbing herself like a maniac. Not with a cop sitting there, watching the door. Not unless she wanted to explain herself. She couldn’t risk being stopped, even for a question.

So she sat, one hand back between her legs, praying he would drive off.

Minutes passed.

The cop wasn’t moving.

Bianca’s bladder wasn’t either.

She had no choice but to wait. So she waited.

Five minutes ticked by like centuries. Her bladder was actively fighting her now. Muscles spasming without warning. It was no longer about clenching—it was about surviving.

Every breath was a shudder, every moment a countdown.

She drummed her fingers on the steering wheel, rocking slowly in her seat, eyes locked on the cop car.

And then finally—it pulled out.

She barely waited for the headlights to clear the corner before she exploded out of her car, practically waddling across the lot with both hands between her thighs. The pain was so intense she couldn’t even feel her legs, just the weight of the ocean inside her and the sharp, needle-like spasms of her tortured urethra.

She was moaning under her breath—tiny, gasping, involuntary noises that sounded almost sexual in the silence of the night.

Ten steps... Seven... Three...

She reached the front door just as the gas station attendant stepped out from behind the counter. A boyish guy in a puffer vest and earbuds—he didn’t even glance her way.

Bianca slammed her hand on the glass, her mouth open to scream “Wait!” But he didn’t hear her. Or didn’t care. He grabbed the shutter handle and with one lazy tug, pulled it down in front of the glass door.

Bianca watched in horror as the metal slammed into place inches from her face, sealing off her salvation.

“NO!” she cried out loud, staggering back a step as her body lurched forward with another spurt. Hot urine spilled into her panties again, soaking the already-wet fabric.

Her knees buckled, legs shaking like she’d just finished a marathon, her face contorted in a raw mixture of agony and betrayal.

She banged on the shutter with both fists.

“Please! I’m still here! I need to use your bathroom, please open up!” she whimpered, voice cracking, tears falling freely now.

Inside, the boy was already locking up the register, earbuds still in, completely oblivious.

Bianca sank to her knees, her head pressed against the cold metal shutter, body shaking violently as her bladder swelled against her waistband like a balloon ready to burst.

There was nowhere else to go.

Her house was still twenty minutes away. Her body wasn’t going to make it.

She had to decide what to do—fast.

And any decision now would come with consequences.

Chapter 8 – "Under Her Thumb"

Bianca stood frozen, staring at the metal shutters that had just slammed down in front of her face. She was seconds too late. Her bladder, stretched and burning from holding nearly two liters for over 14 and a half hours, sent a violent spasm through her core. She gasped and clenched every muscle she could, toes curling in her shoes.

There was no other option now. Home.

She completed another painful waddle back to her car and climbed into the driver’s seat, one hand pressed firmly into her lap, and started the engine. The drive home felt longer than ever. Every bump in the road sent jolts up through her aching abdomen. Her body was screaming for release, her bladder pulsing like a drum.

She glanced at the clock — 9:53 PM.

“Nearly fifteen hours,” she whispered. “Why does it feel like I’ve been holding a lifetime?”

As she turned onto her street, relief was finally in sight. Her porch light was on. She pulled up to the curb, trembling fingers fumbling with the seatbelt. But before she could open the door, a tap on her window startled her. A man stood there, mid-30s, kind face, holding a small box in his hands.

“Hey! Sorry to bother you,” he said as she rolled down the window a crack, legs twisted underneath her. “You live here, right? I’m new in the neighborhood and got a package meant for you.”

Bianca nodded stiffly, pain etched across her face.

“Oh no, are you okay?” the man asked, looking concerned. “You look... really pale.”

“I’m just... not feeling great,” she forced out through clenched teeth.

“Here, I’ll walk you to the door,” he offered kindly. “You really don’t look well.”

Bianca wanted to scream. She couldn’t say no—he was being so genuine. She couldn’t risk seeming rude. So she got out, barely able to stand straight, and followed him toward the front door, her thighs pressed tightly together. Every step was a battle.

He kept chatting—something about the street, the weather—Bianca could barely hear it over the deafening pounding of blood in her ears and the raw ache screaming for release.

Finally, they reached the door.

“Here you go!” he smiled, handing her the package.

“Thanks,” she managed. “I, um... need to lie down.”

“Of course! Hope you feel better soon.” He turned to leave.

Bianca fumbled for her keys, her hands shaking uncontrollably. She was so, so close now.

Inside, she’s laser-focused. The bathroom is just down the hall but she has a plan. After everything she’s endured, she wants to know exactly how much she’s been holding. She heads straight to the kitchen to grab a measuring jug, her steps stiff and short, each one a test of endurance.

She opens a cabinet, slowly bends forward and freezes.

“Bianca,” her mother’s voice cuts through the quiet like a knife. “You didn’t take the bins out this morning like I asked.”

Bianca flinches. Her mother is standing at the kitchen table, arms crossed, clearly annoyed.

“I’m sorry, I forgot,” Bianca manages to say, her voice strained, barely above a whisper.

“You’ve been living here for how long now? I shouldn’t have to remind you to do basic chores every single week,” her mother continues, launching into a well-worn speech about responsibility, time management, and “living under this roof.”

Bianca bites the inside of her cheek and nods silently, her body trembling as she tries to keep her composure. Every second that ticks by feels like a minute. Her legs are locked tight together, her hands gripping the edge of the counter for support.

Her mother, unaware of the internal crisis happening right in front of her, keeps going.

“It’s not just the bins, either. I asked you to fold the laundry, too.”

Bianca doesn’t respond. She can’t. If she opens her mouth, she’s not sure if words—or something else entirely—will come out. She takes a step back toward the hallway.

“Where are you going?” her mother asks.

“Just... I’ll take care of it in a sec,” Bianca says, voice breaking.

She grabs the jug with one hand, the other pressing firmly against her thigh. She nods quickly, then starts her slow, torturous walk toward the bathroom, praying she makes it before one more delay seals her fate.

Just as she turns the corner into the hallway, her mother’s voice calls out sharply from the kitchen again.

"Bianca! Don't walk away from me. I'm sure whatever you're going off to do isn't more important than doing your chores."

Bianca freezes. Her entire body trembles, and for a moment she swears the jug in her hand shifts as if it senses her distress. Her jaw tightens.

“I will, I just—”

“No excuses. It’ll take two minutes. I asked you last night to do it. You can do it now. And also while you're at it, take the clothes out of the washing machine, please.”

Bianca turns around, jaw clenched, trying to stay composed as she nods again and makes her way to the laundry room. Every step is a cruel joke—the pressure inside her feels like a balloon being filled far beyond what it's meant to hold.

Fifteen and a half hours. Over 1,900 milliliters.

She’s done the math in her head more than once, but the numbers don’t help anymore—they just make it more real.

She sets the jug down beside the dryer, her hand now pressing harder between her thighs as she opens the machine. The warm, damp air doesn’t help. Neither does the sudden sensation of lifting something—even a light basket of laundry sends a wave of desperation ripping through her abdomen.

She winces but doesn’t cry out. Folding is out of the question—she dumps the clothes quickly into the basket and starts back toward the hallway, her breaths shallow and quick.

“Don’t forget to empty that bin as well!” her mother adds from the other room. Bianca doesn't answer this time.

Bianca clutches the jug with one trembling hand, the other pressed tightly against her thigh as she hobbles toward the bathroom. Her entire body feels like it's pulsing with urgency. Her bladder, stretched past the point of reason, throbs with every step, a relentless, rhythmic warning that time is nearly up.

She reaches the bathroom door, nudges it open with her foot, and steps inside, breathing heavily. The light flickers on, and the cold tile beneath her feet feels like ice against the warmth of her skin.

She locks the door behind her, finally alone, and sets the jug down carefully on the counter. Every motion is a delicate battle between staying still and exploding. Panting, she lowers her sweatpants and slowly, agonizingly, begins to position herself over the jug.

She looks down and can't even see the jug due to her looking nine months pregnant with a belly full of piss blocking her view.

Her hands shake. Her muscles scream. Her bladder bulges, nearly two liters of boiling pressure begging for release. The moment has come.

A single drop escapes. Then another. A soft hiss begins—

CLUNK.

A sudden thud outside the bathroom door.

Bianca freezes, her heart slamming against her ribs.

“Bianca?” her mother’s voice calls, far too close. “What are you doing in there?”

She panics, clenching down with inhuman effort, stopping the flow before it truly begins. A tear of frustration rolls down her cheek.

“I... I’m just brushing my teeth!” she lies, voice trembling with strain.

There’s a pause. Then the doorknob jiggles.

“I told you to empty this bin. Now get it done,” her mother says.

Bianca’s mouth hangs open. She looks at the jug—so close to salvation—and back at the door. Her bladder lets out another warning pang, a knife of pressure stabbing upward into her ribs. She’s never felt so close to bursting.

“Give me two minutes!” she calls, trying not to scream.

“Now, please!” her mom insists, clearly not picking up on the distress in her voice.

Bianca suffers in silence. Her mom is right outside the door and Bianca doesn’t want her to hear her groan in agony. She bends down to pull her pants back up, hands trembling violently. She hides the jug in the bathroom cabinet to come back to later, unlocking the door and putting on her best poker face.

Her mother is waiting, completely unaware of the storm her daughter is enduring. Bianca’s body feels like it’s running on borrowed time.

Bianca did her best to look normal as she walked back to the kitchen to empty the bin. Each step towards the kitchen with her mother watching felt like a cruel challenge—her body stiff and tense, her breath catching with every jolt.

As she bent into the bin to take the bag out, her stomach bulged out so far that the basket pressed against her abdomen, compounding the pressure she was already trying to suppress. Her legs trembled under the dual burden—trying not to look like she was absolutely busting for a piss in front of her mother, and her own exhaustion.

She bit down hard, blinking through the burn of frustrated tears, determined to finish the chore before anything else could stop her. Every second she spent walking the bag outside felt like a countdown to eruption, each one echoing the desperation she refused to let show.

Bianca reached the back garden, her knees nearly buckling as she adjusted her grip on the bag. Her heart was racing—not just from the physical strain, but from how close she knew she was to pissing herself in front of her mother.

She couldn’t believe she was still holding it together.

She was finally done with her chores and her mother let her be.

All Bianca had to do now was get to the bathroom and she would be free to pee. She told herself. Just a few more steps.

As she rounded the corner with the bathroom in sight, her phone buzzed loudly in her pocket. She froze.

For a second, she debated ignoring it. But something in her gut—maybe guilt, maybe the hope that this would finally be the last interruption—pushed her to check it.

It was Keely.

Bianca hesitated, then picked it up and answered, trying to keep her voice steady.

“Hey.”

“Hey girl, just checking in. Did you finally pee yet?” Keely asked with a laugh. “I’ve been thinking about you all evening. You seriously looked like you were gonna pass out.”

Bianca closed her eyes, leaning against the bathroom door.

“No,” she said through gritted teeth, the frustration cracking her voice.

There was a pause on the other end of the line.

“What? Are you serious? Bianca, it’s almost eleven o’clock. It’s been, like, sixteen hours!”

“Trust me, I know,” she said, her voice raw.

Keely’s tone shifted, the joking edge gone.

“Oh my God. Are you okay?”

Bianca looked down at her shaking hands, then toward the bathroom door.

“I don’t know,” she whispered. “But I’m going. Right now.”

She hung up and set the phone down. This had gone on long enough.

Chapter 9 – "A Mother's Hold, A Daughter's Release"

Bianca’s whole body trembles as she stumbles toward the bathroom door, finally within reach of the relief she’s been craving for the past 16 hours. She can feel her bladder—swollen and rock hard—pressing against her lower abdomen with every step. Every muscle in her body is clenched in an effort to hold back the deluge, but it feels like she’s about to break apart any second.

She reaches the door handle. The pain is almost unbearable now, waves of desperation crashing over her like a flood. She can’t hold it anymore. Her bladder, stretched to its limit, feels like it could burst at any moment. The only thing keeping her from losing control is sheer willpower.

Her legs tremble, barely holding her up. She bites down on her lip, trying to hold back the whimper that wants to escape, but every second feels like an eternity. A sharp spasm twists through her, her vision going blurry for a moment. Her knees nearly buckle as the urge to release becomes overwhelming.

No, not yet. Not here.

With a final, desperate breath, Bianca forces herself to turn the doorknob and push the door open. The cold air of the bathroom greets her, sending a shiver down her spine, but it’s the last thing on her mind. She staggers into the room, eyes fixed on the cabinet that contains the jug.

Just a few more seconds. Hold it together.

Her body screams in protest, but she stumbles toward the toilet, her heart racing as her bladder pulses against her insides like a ticking time bomb. As she passes the mirror, she catches a glimpse of herself—disheveled, exhausted, and on the edge of complete collapse. Her face is pale, her eyes glassy, tears just barely contained as they threaten to fall.

She feels like she’s at her breaking point, but somehow, she keeps moving, her steps shaky but deliberate.

She reaches into the cabinet and grabs the jug, her breath coming in short, ragged gasps as another wave of pressure crashes through her lower abdomen. A fresh leak escapes. She gasps, her thighs locking together involuntarily as she desperately tries to clamp down.

I can’t stop it now... I can’t.

She can barely think as she hoists the jug in front of her, one trembling hand on the rim and the other still gripping herself, trying to hold back the flood that is threatening to pour out of her. Every nerve in her body is humming, buzzing with a need so intense it’s painful.

With a cry of sheer frustration, she yanks her pants down, her body trembling violently, and positions herself over the jug.

The moment she does, it’s like her body has a mind of its own.

The floodgates open.

A hot, desperate stream bursts forth—a wave of release so powerful it almost knocks her off balance. For a moment, she just stands there, completely still, as her body takes over.

The sound of the release is all-encompassing—a steady hiss that fills the room as the jug slowly fills, her bladder finally letting go of its agonizing pressure.

It feels like an eternity, but Bianca barely registers the passing time, consumed by the sensation of relief washing over her. Her legs quiver beneath her, her muscles weak from the strain, but she doesn't stop. She doesn’t even care about the jug anymore, or the mess, or anything.

All that matters is that she’s finally letting go.

Her mind is a haze of relief and exhaustion. The pain in her abdomen slowly ebbs as her bladder empties. She gasps for breath, tears rolling down her cheeks as she finally allows herself to cry out in the release.

She had done it.

She had held on.

When the last drop falls into the jug, Bianca is left standing there, breathless and trembling, staring at the container in disbelief.

She had made it.

But she knows that’s not the end of it. She still has to clean up. She still has to face her mother. She still has to face everything.

But for now, all she can do is lean against the counter—utterly spent—her entire body shaking as the reality of what she’s just endured sets in.

She lets herself breathe.

She lets herself be proud of making it this far, even if the relief is bittersweet.

For now, she’s safe.

And that’s all that matters.

Epilogue – Comfort and Connection

As Bianca sat there catching her breath, a soothing calm washed over her. The sharp fire that had consumed her moments before was gone, replaced by a soft warmth that spread through her body like a healing balm. She took a deep, steadying breath and smiled faintly to herself. Today had been one of the hardest days she could remember—but she’d made it through. Somehow, she always did.

After freshening up and completing her mother’s request, she headed to the living room just as her phone buzzed with a message. It was from Samantha:

"You okay? We’ve been worried about you all day!"

Bianca’s heart lifted. She quickly typed back: "Finally peed now. Definitely need some serious rest."

Within minutes, her phone rang. It was Keely.

“Hey, Bianca! You sound better. Want us to come over? We could bring snacks and just chill.”

Bianca chuckled softly, feeling the warmth of friendship wrap around her like a cozy blanket.

“That sounds perfect,” she said. “I could really use the company.”

As she settled into the couch, the events of the day began to fade into the background. With her friends by her side, Bianca felt lighter—ready to laugh again, to breathe freely, and to finally let go of the tension that had held her captive for so long.

As the three of them were chatting away on the couch together, Samantha chimed in with a smile in her voice:

“Hey, at least we won the football match, right? Totally worth all the crazy shit.”

Keely laughed.

“Yeah, you held it together on the field better than anyone. You’re a champ, Bianca.”

Bianca smiled, her spirit lifting with their words. The day’s struggles were behind her.

For now, all that mattered was comfort, friendship, and the simple joy of being home. The End.

Just under 2 litres, I should've made this more clear in the story
