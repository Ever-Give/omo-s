Hugo had decided to take River and Duncan grocery shopping, and then maybe to the hardware store afterwards if they were up to it. He thought that this would be a good ‘second try’ for them. The mall had been too much. It had been a big place, pretty far from the cabin. But, these stores were both smaller, close by, would still have lots of people, and there were security cameras. If someone tried to lead River or Duncan somewhere that they didn’t want to go, another person would surely notice, and the cameras would record the whole thing, too.

River agreed to go. He wanted to visit the hardware store— The hardware store was related to his job. To making himself useful. To doing the things he was SUPPOSED to be doing. He didn’t voice his reasoning aloud to Hugo, though. He knew that Hugo would try to convince him that he WAS still useful, and that he didn’t need to be in their workroom all the time to BE useful. That when he WAS able to help out, that was enough.

If Hugo said those things, River would believe he meant them. But, River wouldn’t believe for a second that they were actually TRUE. River DID still come into the workroom and assist Hugo with projects, he kept track of the requests from their customers, he painted things after they’d been assembled.

But, River wasn’t as useful as he once was. Because, NOW, sometimes Hugo would turn on a power-tool, and it would make all this noise, and suddenly River would feel very, very scared, and like he was trapped inside the workroom without any way out, and he’d start to… Breathe wrong, like he was choking even though nothing was caught in his throat. The room would blur, and River would only feel like he was partly in the present, one foot in the workroom with Hugo, the other back in the torture chamber the Organization had put him in.

And then, Hugo would have to waste so much time holding River, rubbing his back, telling him to stay calm… Time that they both should have spent working. Time that River should have spent being useful, instead of being a burden.

River was supposed to be able to take care of himself.

He’d done it for years…

If he went to the store with Hugo, if he helped him pick out supplies, he would be a little useful again.

Duncan took some more convincing. To Hugo’s surprise, he was mostly just freaked out because of what had happened to River during the mall trip. He didn’t want to see River in pain again. “I’ll go pee before we leave,” River said. “I’ve never gone out without peeing first, ask Hugo.”

Hugo shrugged, then nodded. He didn’t think River had ever forgotten to take a toilet break before they went out on deliveries in the old days… It just hadn’t ever made that big of a difference since River had to go so frequently.

“Besides,” River added. “Now that I think I know why I couldn’t pee at the mall, I know I’ll be fine so long as the restroom isn’t empty.”

“O—Okay,” Duncan said. “We can go…”

Before they headed out the next day, Duncan kept reminding River to go the whole time they were getting dressed. After the third reminder, River snorted. “Duncan, it’s okay,” he said. “I’m not gonna forget— I didn’t even forget the day we went to the mall, I’ve just got a small bladder.” He took off his pajama shirt, then put his arms over his chest to cover it.

“That makes me more nervou—“ Duncan stopped. “Why are you covering up, silly? You wanna tease me?”

River blushed. “N—No…” he said. “I— We don’t normally get dressed together, and—“

Duncan took off his own shirt and tossed it aside. He stood beside River, hands on his hips. “Is it a little too exciting?”

River looked away, face going even redder. Duncan’s chest was so… River hadn’t known his stomach muscles were so pronounced. He remembered Duncan mentioned he’d liked to dance back during his old life, so that must have been how he got so toned… But, beyond that, Duncan’s chest was so… smooth. Unblemished. Unmarred.

“I…” River struggled. “My chest is all…” he lowered his arms. “This…”

Duncan looked. River was lithe, his nipples were pink and Duncan suddenly found himself thinking how good it would feel to give them a lick. But, Duncan knew what River was focused on— The biggest difference between his own chest and Duncan’s wasn’t that Duncan was more muscular.

Duncan had felt the roughness of those scars a few times when he’d reached a hand up River’s shirt to touch him. The first time he’d felt them, he’d been confused for half a second before remembering what they were. It had never bothered Duncan at all that River had those scars, because Duncan knew that they’d come from something that had made River happy. The same went for the one now visible on River’s bare arm.

River had other scars that DID make Duncan sad. Little jagged ones from the Organization, or from fights River had gotten into. Those only upset Duncan because they’d come from things that had harmed River.

But, Duncan didn’t think ANYTHING was wrong with the scars below River’s nipples, or the one that went down his arm. “I know,” Duncan said. “It’s not exactly the same as mine. But, that’s not a bad thing.”

“You don’t think they look gross?” River asked.

“No,” Duncan shook his head.

“Not even…” River raised his arm. The scar there was more pronounced than the ones on his chest were, redder in places…

“No,” Duncan repeated. “Those are just parts of my boyfriend’s body, and I LIKE his body…” He hoped that was the right thing to say. As far as Duncan was concerned, River was just the really, really hot guy that he was lucky enough to call his partner. But, several nights, River had mentioned other people calling him hot before though, and how those people hadn’t truly meant it. “They were just fascinated by WHAT I was, that’s as deep as it ever went with any of them.”

Duncan didn’t think he was the same way. River being intersex and having had surgeries was something that interested Duncan a little, since he’d just never met anybody like that before, but he didn’t think that was the same thing. He HOPED not, anyway. He thought River’s chest was really sexy, scars and all, but that was because it was part of River. He hoped River could see that.

And, Duncan had had body issues of his own in the past— who hadn’t?— He’d had the most terrible acne when he was a teenager, he’d always thought his nose looked a little crooked…

But, he supposed, those things couldn’t really compare to the complex relationship River had had with his body. Anything Duncan had to offer about it probably wouldn’t be what River needed.

River smiled at him, so Duncan decided he must have said something right.

“M—Maybe… Maybe I’ll take my shirt off for you more…”

Duncan bit his lip to keep from grinning. Now he had something to look forward to.

They took off their pants, and Duncan caught River looking at his butt, clad only in his boxers. Duncan wriggled slightly. “Heh, see something you like?”

River somehow managed to go redder, and his smile grew. This was the Duncan he’d FIRST met, before they’d made the discovery that the Organization was planning to kill them, when they’d been just two relaxed guys getting to know each other. The playful, flirty side of him… “Eheh, yeah…” he said.

“I know I see something I like…” Duncan added. “Think those boxers are too tight, or are you just happy to see me?”

“Pfft, that’s the worst line…” River laughed. “You… You really think I look… ‘big’?”

“You do,” Duncan said. “I mean, if I was getting a new dick, I would have asked for, like, three feet. So, I commend you on your restraint, but what you have is great.”

“Haha, well… My forearm’s not three feet long, so that would have been tricky anyways…”

They finished dressing, and River gave Duncan a hug. “Thanks…” he said. “I think we can get dressed in front of each other more often now. I’ve been wanting to, but I’ve been all nervous, and—“

“Don’t be nervous,” Duncan said. “I will never, EVER object to seeing you get naked.” He paused. “Oh, and use the bathroom before we leave, okay? Don’t forget!”

River laughed again. “Duncan, trust me, I drank a whole bottle of water earlier, my bladder’s not gonna let me forget…”

Duncan had thought River had been a little fidgety the last few minutes… But, he also hadn’t thought the water bottle River had emptied had been that big. His bladder really WAS pretty small, and Duncan hoped that he’d be able to handle the trip without another emergency.

The two left their room, and River immediately headed to the toilet. His steps were quick, and he seemed to be trying not to bend his knees too much. Duncan heard him unzipping his pants before he’d even gotten into the room.

‘Wow,’ Duncan thought as he stood beside the front door to wait. ‘He went right after he got up, and didn’t even drink that much, and then he was already acting like he had to go super bad…’ He’d known for ages that River couldn’t hold his pee as long as HE could, and hadn’t ever given it TOO much thought. After seeing River’s agony during the mall trip though, Duncan was worried about going out where restrooms would be few and far between— Especially if there was a chance he’d get too scared again and wouldn’t be able to go!

Duncan heard the toilet flush, and River came out looking more at ease. They waited together a few more minutes until Hugo came out of his own room and said it was time to go.

***

Riding in a car still felt weird to River and Duncan. They were unused to being in moving vehicles again. Duncan wondered if this was what it felt like to a baby when they were in a car for the first time. As soon as they were out of the woods and hit the first speed-bump, Duncan flinched at the bounce and something else struck him.

He’d spent so much time reminding River to use the bathroom before they left, but he HADN’T remembered to use it himself.

Duncan hadn’t relieved himself since he’d woken up that morning. It had been several hours, and he’d had a bit more to drink than River… And now that he’d registered the pressure beneath his fly, he couldn’t get it to fade away from his mind again. The irritating, buzzing tingle scolding him for skipping his toilet break was loud and pronounced.

How long would these errands take? Could he try to hold it until he got home, or would he have to pee somewhere while they were out? To his dismay, he found that the prospect of using the toilet before they returned to the cabin a little scary. It would be his first time visiting a public restroom since before the Organization… And those security cameras Hugo had said would keep him and River safe wouldn’t be in the bathrooms. They would be a good place to corner someone.

That would ONLY be able to happen if Duncan was alone, though. If there were lots of others in the restroom, nothing bad would happen. It was just like River, Duncan didn’t think he could go in public if no one was watching.

He shouldn’t be worrying about this anyway. This trip would be short, he’d be back at the cabin before he had an emergency. He’d just hold it in.

They reached the grocery store, and Duncan started to feel anxious. There was a flurry of butterflies in his stomach, and they all seemed to be floating downwards, pressing their weight into his bladder. He knew the sudden spike in his need was just nervousness, but that didn’t make it feel any less real.

He unlatched his seatbelt, and felt a little better now that it wasn’t adding to the pressure inside his body. Beside him, River undid his seatbelt as well, but then he just sat there, looking out the window. “R—Ready?” He asked Duncan.

Duncan nodded, tried to say that he was. He felt the peculiar sensation of his jaw muscles tightening around one another again, and only managed to mumble it out. “Y—Yes…”

River took his hand and squeezed it, then got out of the car. Duncan followed him. The pavement felt strange beneath his feet— His SHOES felt a little strange too, for that matter. At the cabin, he and River often just went barefoot, or only wore socks. Duncan had never noticed before that shoes were actually kind of heavy…

They weren’t the only things weighing him down though. The nervous tingling buzzes in his midsection were not fading, they were just getting stronger, wrapping a rope around his still filling bladder and making him really sort of wish that he was at home right now, sitting on the toilet with his pants down around his ankles.

Duncan… Duncan could hold it until that fantasy came true. He could keep it in. He had to go, it was urgent enough that he couldn’t ignore it, but he could and WOULD manage to wait this out. Hugo came around from the other side of the car to stand next to Duncan and River. “Really quick trip,” he promised them. “Nice and easy.”

Duncan nibbled his lip and hoped Hugo was right, if only for the sake of his bladder.

Inside the store, Duncan pressed himself to River’s side and clutched his hand. River rubbed his arm gently, but his hands trembled and his touch wasn’t nearly as soothing as he wanted it to be. Duncan felt so ridiculous, being scared in a grocery store of all places. How many horrible disasters had happened HERE, for God’s sake…

He was also feeling a bit more uncomfortable. Since none of them knew how to cook, they’d gone right past several sections of the store, but the brief time they’d spent in produce had been long enough for Duncan’s ears to be subjected to the sound of the water misters going off and spritzing the vegetables. The hiss of liquid had been enough to prompt Duncan to rub his knees together and adjust his waistband— which had suddenly started feeling too tight.

Duncan relaxed more when they got to the cereal aisle. No liquid there, no running water, nothing to make him think about how much he would have preferred to be in a bathroom. Hugo asked River and Duncan to agree on a cereal, and that sort of reminded Duncan of when he was little and he and his sister had argued over which flavor to get.

Duncan was about to name his favorite, but then he heard a loud crashing sound in one of the other aisles. He got that pinching feeling inside his throat, the sensation of his words being forced back down before he’d been able to fully conjure them. He opened his mouth, but nothing came out. Something almost DID come out of another part of Duncan’s body though, his bladder squeezed in viciously at his fright, and he very nearly let a spurt go into his pants.

River had flinched at the noise too, and his grip on Duncan had tightened. “I—It’s just… Something got dropped, th—that’s all…” River knew that it COULDN’T have been anything more than that, but was still relieved when a voice came over the loudspeakers announcing that a spill had to be cleaned.

Duncan involuntarily shook a little at the wording. A ‘spill’… He might end up making one of tho— What?! No! No he wouldn’t! He only SORT OF had to go. He wasn’t going to have an accident… Even if getting startled like that had almost jarred something loose, he was STILL totally dry. He would STAY totally dry!

“Let’s… Let’s pick a cereal, guys,” Hugo said. He’d been unable to miss their reactions to the crash. Something that would, at most, just make most people jump at the suddenness had made River and Duncan huddle together in fear…

Duncan, again, was about to name his favorite, but he had trouble moving his mouth, so he just grabbed it and showed River.

River looked at it, but shook his head. “I—I’m sure it’s really good, Duncan. But I’m super allergic to chocolate, so it’s gotta be something different.”

Duncan put the box back. He’d have to remember that when it came time to get River a romantic gift… If he and River ever got to be a regular couple that could get little surprises like that for one another, anyway. Duncan picked a different box that was fruit flavored, and River agreed to that one.

It hit River then; Duncan wasn’t speaking again.

River took his hand once more, and whispered to him. “You feeling okay, Duncan?”

Duncan nodded.

Still no talking… River’s brow knit with concern. He tried to think of something other than a yes-or-no question. “I’m sure there’s stuff you like that Hugo’s never brought home. What’s something you want?”

Hugo had never brought home any microwave popcorn, and Duncan had been missing it. He wanted some today, except nobody would KNOW that if he didn’t say something about it. “P…Pop…” he struggled. His throat felt so closed off, like something was caught in there. It was hard to breathe, let alone talk… “P—“

“Popcorn?” River asked. He wished he hadn’t cut Duncan off like that, he’d just been so relieved to hear him make SOUNDS at all that he’d gotten carried away.

 Duncan nodded again. Embarrassment was starting to join his anxiety. If someone saw him this way… Saw River having to coax words from him, having to guide him into such basic communication… They were going to think something was really WRONG with Duncan. A grown man should be able to say whatever was on his mind.

It wasn’t even just fear that was making it hard to talk, it was turning into this actual, physical problem. His nerves got super high, and then everything that controlled his speech seemed to just… Break. It was scary. In the past, Duncan had been such a chatterbox! He’d been loud, talkative, open. He hadn’t been like this. He’d been nothing like this.

River rubbed his thumb over Duncan’s hand, and Duncan started to melt. River didn’t think something was wrong with him. River loved him even if he couldn’t talk right now. As Duncan relaxed into River’s touch, an earlier discomfort came back to him. The water-level within his bladder had risen, more pee asking to be let out, and making demands which were far louder than any noise Duncan had made so far today.

He definitely was going to need a toilet really soon, his urge for it kept getting worse, the liquid he’d had throughout the day seeming to catch up with him in fast-forward. Throughout the rest of the store, Duncan found himself needing to press his thighs together and squeeze River a bit too firmly to offset the pressure in his body.

When they went down the soda aisle, Duncan fidgeted more strongly. The fluid may have all been staying stationary within the bottles, but the sight of it was still a LOT for his bladder to take in. His nose twitched and his lip trembled as his cruel mind kept wondering how the amount of liquid in his bladder compared to the amount in each of the soda bottles. Then, it reminded him of how useful an empty bottle could really be. And of the bottles of water he’d had earlier, of how they were now trying to cram themselves into an organ that didn’t have much vacant space left.

When River picked up a few sodas and put them in the cart, Duncan flinched, unable to look away from how they sloshed, unable to ignore the sound they made. His knees turned inwards and he knelt down slightly, exhaling hard through his nose.

River saw Duncan twitching, and returned to his side to grip his hand. “Right here, Duncan… I’m right here…” he said. “I’m sorry, I didn’t like letting go of you.”

Duncan clutched River’s hand with all his strength. What Duncan really wanted to squeeze onto was his crotch. Just for a few seconds while he calmed his bladder back down. But, he restrained himself. He didn’t want to think he was that desperate yet… He WASN’T that desperate yet. Just… Every step he took, he needed to clench up his thighs because he felt a leak coming on, and he was unable to stop thinking about how comfortable a toilet seat would feel right about now.

But, he wasn’t at ALL desperate to go, because this wasn’t a good PLACE to be desperate to go. If he really WAS desperate here, he’d have to brave a public toilet, where the safe security cameras wouldn’t be, where ANYONE could be hiding out and where, if no one was around to notice, Duncan could be hurt.

Therefor, Duncan could still hold it.

Simple.

When they arrived at checkout, it felt less simple. The bathrooms were right past all the cash registers. The men’s room looked EXTREMELY inviting, the door unobstructed, the sign promising relief. Duncan couldn’t look away from it, memories swirling of how EASY it had once been to use the restroom at a grocery store. It hadn’t been anything he’d needed to think about or get worked up over. He’d just notice the need to pee, and then go pee. Like a normal person. No fear, no anxiety, just the loss of an uncomfortable pressure so he could go on with the rest of his day.

He couldn’t DO that now, though! There were so many places to HIDE in a public restroom. Any of the stalls could be a death trap. If… If Duncan saw a few people go in there in the next few minutes. A whole bunch of potential witnesses to any trouble, then he’d go. He kept his eyes fixated on the door, wishing people would go through it, guarantee to him that that room WASN’T empty and frightening. He crossed his legs and rubbed a foot against the opposite ankle. No one was entering the restroom. He seemed to be the only one in the store who needed to use it, but he was also the only one who was too SCARED to do so.

River had picked up on Duncan’s antsy behavior. He’d been anxious through this whole trip as well, and was glad it was nearly over and nothing bad had happened. Duncan still looked so frightened though. River pulled him into a hug, whispering to him “We made it…”

Duncan went tense in River’s arms, River had pressed them together way too close, his bladder was being smooshed right up against River’s body, waves of urgency flaring out from it, it soared through his abdomen and smashed back down through his length, heat firing up to his tip, scorching at his urethral opening, and then pooling warmly against the crotch of his boxers. “Mmmfff…” Duncan whimpered, hitching his hips and trying to stop the flow. ‘Please, River!’ He wanted to say. ‘Excuse me, I want the restroom!’ But, the only thing that would come out were more whimpering moans of distress as he finally pinched his stream back off.

And all they did was CONFIRM to River that Duncan was simply just still anxious about being outside. “Ev—Everything went okay here,” River said. “We all stayed close together, we’re safe when we’re together…”

Duncan nodded, an idea hitting him. ‘Yes!’ He thought. ‘Safe together! You and Hugo need to take me to the bathroom, please?’ But, he didn’t MANAGE anything beyond the nod! River and Hugo couldn’t take him to the restroom if neither of them realized he needed it!

He could… He could tell them without words! He could jump all around, hold himself, cross his legs back and forth, do the most exaggerated pee dance ANYONE had ever done, and RIGHT away they’d think; ‘Oh, Duncan has to use the toilet really bad, we should take him there now.’

But… But that would be… Utterly humiliating. He’d been anxious about people noticing his difficulty talking! A guy, doing a babyish potty dance in public, while unable to vocalize even one word… That wasn’t who Duncan was! That wasn’t who Duncan ever wanted to be! No one was going to see him that way!

He’d probably be able to talk again when they got back to the car. When it was just THEM again. He’d tell them THEN that he had to go as soon as they reached the hardware store, and say that Hugo needed to go WITH him otherwise he’d feel too scared. That too would be embarrassing, but it wasn’t ‘doing a really obvious, intense piss-dance in the middle of a grocery store’ levels of embarrassing.

Duncan just hoped he could make it back to the car before he started dancing like that unintentionally. His bladder felt really swollen. He’d caught River admiring his stomach muscles earlier, and wondered how visible they even still were. His bladder was probably pulling all that skin really taut. He was sure his abdominal region was no less firm, but now that tension was from a straining ball of urine rather than muscle.

Hugo finally paid for everything and led Duncan and River out of the store. Duncan bit back a moan when they walked past the restroom. Again, he tried to conjure up some words. ‘Wait, hold on! I need to go! Please come with me!’ But they failed to materialize, and then they were out the door, and his chance was gone.

Through the parking lot, Duncan struggled. He kept fumbling over his own feet, needing to grip River tighter to avoid falling over. His breathing was coming out in choppy, pained gasps, like he was trying to bike through molasses instead of simply walk across a parking lot. Sweat rolled off his face in sheets, his body fighting to withstand the stretch inside of it. Ohhhh, why hadn’t he gone before they’d left!? He’d be FINE if he’d done that! He’d be anxious, but at least his bladder wouldn’t be trying to burn a hole through his middle.

Hugo unlocked the car, and Duncan was the first inside of it. He slammed his door shut and stuffed both of his hands between his legs. “Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go…” Duncan moaned, his voice returning in an instant to give life to the words he’d been trying to force out for so long. “Ohhhh, I gotta peeeeee….”

He tore his hands away from his dick when the other door opened and River climbed in. Duncan wasn’t sure why he’d even let go, since his whole plan was to alert River and Hugo to his need… He’d just… He’d gotten so embarrassed!

“River—“ Duncan panted. “River—“

River let out a pleased sigh at the sound of Duncan’s voice. “We did it…” he said. “We stayed calm in there.”

“River—“ Duncan tried again.

Before he could continue, Hugo got into the driver’s seat and they were off to their next destination. “I am VERY proud of you two,” he said. “I know that wasn’t easy, and I’m impressed by how relaxed you both were.”

“I think it helped that it wasn’t super big,” River said. “It also helped that I wasn’t so focused on not peeing my pants.” He laughed then.

Duncan flinched, bouncing his knees rapidly and crossing his ankles. His fingers curled around his leather seat— and dear GOD, how he wished it were one made of porcelain instead… “Hugo, I—“

“Do you feel up to going to the hardware store, too?”

“Y—Yes,” Duncan answered. “And, I—“

“Yeah,” River agreed. “We should be—“

“I need to go to the bathroom!” Duncan blurted out, and now that he’d said it, he went back to holding himself, doubling over, hands buried in the crease his body created.

River stared at Duncan’s twitching, pained position. “… You had to go the whole time we were at the store, didn’t you?” He asked.

“Yessss!” Duncan moaned. “I— I wanted to ask you and Hugo to go with me when we were checking out, but I— I—“

“You… Couldn’t talk,” River stated. “That’s it, right? When you’re scared, you have trouble saying anything?”

Duncan glanced up and nodded. “And, the only other way I could think of to tell you I had to pee, was to…”

“Do… Kinda what you’re doing now?” River guessed. “But, in public where it would have been really embarrassing?”

“Yeah.”

“Aw, Duncan, I’m sorry!” River said. “I thought you were JUST scared, I didn’t realize you also had to—“

“The hardware store’s REALLY close,” Hugo said. “It’s quicker to get there than it is to get back to the cabin. Five more minutes, is that okay?”

“Y—Yes,” Duncan said. “But, I need to— Right when we get there, I need to…”

“As soon as we’re through the door, don’t worry,” Hugo said. “I kinda gotta go too, so I’ll be with you.”

Duncan gritted his teeth, crossed his legs, and held onto himself for dear life as he begged the car to move just a little faster. Five minutes weren’t long, but they could still be excruciating in the right circumstances.

Hugo parked as close to the store as he could, hoping to minimize the amount of steps separating Duncan from the toilets. Hugo tried to remember which side of the store the restrooms were on, and hoped he’d gotten it right.

Duncan yanked off his seatbelt and scrambled from the car. He jumped from foot to foot, wishing he could just run straight in there by himself, calling “I’ll meet back up with you by the entrance!” Over his shoulder as he ran to the nearest available toilet. He couldn’t, though. He had to wait, he had to wait so River and Hugo could go WITH him and ensure he felt safe and secure. Hugo, Duncan knew, would keep him and River safe anywhere.

River came to Duncan’s side and put an arm around his trembling shoulders. Even now that he was out of the car, Duncan hadn’t moved his hands away from his groin. Poor guy was overflowing… River couldn’t believe he hadn’t realized back at the other store! “I’m so sorry…” he said. “It will all be over soon.”

Duncan just kept dancing in place. He didn’t care if someone noticed now. His flailing, frantic motions were still less embarrassing than soaked pants would be, and if he stopped moving even for a second, he’d drench himself from the waist down immediately.

Hugo came around and led them inside. He was relieved when they walked through the door and the sign for the restrooms was right beside them. Duncan’s eyes latched onto it, his bladder roiling and doing somersaults in his belly. He had to pee so bad that he was getting nauseas.

“Okay, right here…” Hugo said, taking them down the small corridor.

Duncan spurted and leaked with each step, drips leaving him as his bladder became determined to explode right at the finish line. ‘Please, please, just a few more seconds, I can make it…’

“O—Oh no…”

Hugo’s voice.

“FUCK!”

River’s.

Duncan opened his pinched shut eyes. Then blinked them several times. What he saw in front of him couldn’t have been real. It was impossible. Not NOW. Not when he was already peeing in his pants, not when every second added another gallon to his impossible burden.

But no matter how long Duncan stared, the sign on the door refused to change.

The men’s room was being cleaned.

Duncan wasn’t going to get to use a toilet any time soon.

But, there was no space left in his bladder for that! There was no room in there at all! He was filled to the brim, half his body weight was surely made up of urine. His kidneys were floating. His teeth hurt. His eyes burned. He felt like he was going to cry, and then pee his pants.

The women’s room was open! Could Duncan ask the others to go in there WITH him, though? That would be… That would be super hard for River, wouldn’t it? Really, really uncomfortable… But, Duncan couldn’t hold it any longer, and there were TOILETS in there, and he needed one NOW, and the only difference would be the lack of urinals and the SIGN on the door, and—

Spurt… Hsss…

And Duncan was PEEING, and— His eyes welled up, he clutched himself more firmly. He was so lost in his own Hell that he didn’t feel River and Hugo rushing him out of the store, didn’t notice until he was outside again and the sun was blinding him. He was so confused, so disoriented. Fuck… He needed somewhere…

God, there were all those display toilets hardware stores always had in the plumbing section! He could use one of those! Yeah, yeah, yeah! So long as Hugo bought it afterwards, no one would complain! Duncan would PEE, and everything would be fine, and—

He realized River was helping him back into the car, and he panicked. “I can’t hold it all the way home! I need— I gotta use one of the—“ He fumbled, trying to explain his brilliant ‘display toilet’ idea, and this time his inability to find his words had everything to do with delirious desperation rather than fear.

He heard things being tossed around in the trunk, and then the absolutely torturous sound of running water, which prompted more liquid to seep into his already sodden pants. “Nnnnh…. River—“

“Hold on,” River encouraged him. “You can do it…”

The driver’s side door popped open, and Duncan heard Hugo’s voice speaking to River, “Here—“

“Thank you…” River said. “Duncan, move your hands.”

Duncan whipped his head back and forth. “I’ll pee!”

“It’s gonna be okay…” River said, gently brushing Duncan’s hands away even as he made little, mewling protests, begging that he NEEDED to hold himself otherwise he’d GO.

Duncan heard his zipper come apart, and that noise was way too much. His dam split apart, shattered into millions of pieces, and he was pissing with such a violent force it almost hurt coming out. His face scrunched up further in dismay, he couldn’t stop! He’d lost it, he was wetting his pants in a public parking lot— Hugo was gonna be mad that he’d peed all over the seat!

Duncan realized a few seconds later that he didn’t feel any warmer, and there was a noise he couldn’t identify, a rattling sound…

“There…” River said in a soft, encouraging tone. “There you go… That’s better…”

Duncan finally opened his eyes back up, and saw that he WASN’T having an accident after all. River was aiming his tip into the opening of one of the large soda bottles they’d bought, and he was in the process of throughly re-filling it.

“Sorry you had to hear Hugo pouring this thing out,” River said, still focused on directing Duncan’s stream for him. “A—And I’m sorry that I’m… Fuck, I shoulda asked first before I started touching you…”

“It’s…” Duncan panted out, chest rising and falling slowly as the tension slipped away from him. “It’s alright… I was… Losing it…”

“I know…” River said. “You… Er… You want me to keep—“

“I’m…” Duncan gasped. His body was floating, he was barely aware of where he was anymore. All he could comprehend was that, suddenly, he was feeling loads better. “I’m too… You do it…”

“Okay,” River said, focusing again. Wow, Duncan had so much in him… No wonder he’d been flipping out like that. This was a liter bottle, he’d already filled it past the halfway mark. River wasn’t sure if he could do that even when at his MOST desperate. Duncan had gone super limp, which made the job of aiming for him pretty easy. With his eyes shut and his breathing so slow and relaxed, he almost looked like he’d fallen asleep while gushing.

Duncan wasn’t asleep though. He was awake, and mostly alert. As alert as one could be while lost in a world of unfathomable relief, anyway. It took him longer than he’d like to admit to truly register the fact that River was touching his dick. River’s hand was wrapped around it, direct skin-to-skin contact for the first time.

Oh… Oh noooo! Duncan’s first time touching River’s penis had been while helping him piss, and now the REVERSE was true, too! The— The first time wasn’t supposed to be this way! He’d wanted it to come when they were in the midst of heavy, passionate kissing, and had been unable to contain their excitement any longer!

But… River WAS still touching him now. And… And that felt really, really good. Almost as good as peeing did. Now, if only River would start moving his hand a little bit, just up and down nice and slow… As Duncan’s stream tapered off, his cock started to twitch, he felt it expanding, felt it aching for more of River’s touch, felt—

“O—Oh gosh!” River said, hurriedly screwing the cap back onto the soda bottle.

Duncan’s eyes opened again, and he remembered where he was. And that it wasn’t the right place for a tryst with River— Especially not their first. River was covering his face now, blushing.

Hugo, still facing forward in the driver’s seat, asked “Did something spill?”

“Nah—No!” River said. “Don’t look back here!”

Now Duncan was blushing too, he shoved his member back into his pants and zipped up. Fuck, how had he forgotten he and River weren’t even ALONE? How could he have let himself get… Like THAT here…

“Duncan? You done?” Hugo asked. “You decent?”

Duncan didn’t feel ‘decent’ at all. He felt like a total pervert… “Uh— Yeah, I… Finished peeing.”

“You wanna go back into the store? You’re not… too… uh…”

“T—Too what!?” Duncan asked, panicking. Had Hugo seen it through the rearview mirror? Did he know Duncan had gotten way, WAY too excited?

“Er… Wet…” Hugo said awkwardly.

Oh. Right… Duncan had ALSO partially pissed his pants today. He’d forgotten that part somehow. “…Yeah, I think we should save this for another time,” he said.

“Okay,” Hugo said. “No problem.”
