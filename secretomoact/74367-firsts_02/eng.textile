Thanks! I've been a little bit slower with updates lately because I'm preparing fics for the Omovember challenge this year. I hope that getting one update per day for a month will make the delays worth it 🙂

Written for the Omovember prompt "Interrupted While Going."

***

Adam had expected Alex to be a bit more scared of flying than he actually was. He knew Alex had never been on a plane before, and Adam remembered how nerve-wracking his own first flight had been. He just hadn’t understood how several tons of metal could stay up in the air like that, it didn’t make any sense to him at all. Adam was less scared of flying now, though he still really disliked it. Air travel took a pretty heavy toll on the environment, after all.

But, sometimes flying was necessary. Adam wanted to take Alex to see the Grand Canyon, and that was much too far away for them to drive. So, the time had come for Alex’s first trip on a plane. Adam was impressed by how calm he was about it, how it didn’t seem to frighten him at all. Alex was more excited than anything. His mood changed as they got through security though.

Alex was randomly selected to undergo a pat-down procedure. Adam cringed when Alex was pulled aside for this and felt his blood boil as he watched it happen. Adam knew the TSA agent was just doing his job, but when he saw how many times the guy pressed his hands around Alex’s crotch, saw how Alex’s face started to turn pink and his body began to tremble, it was a challenge not to start shouting at the guy to back off. ‘He’s not doing it on purpose,’ Adam told himself. ‘He’s not trying to make Alex feel bad.’

Once they got through the checkpoint, Adam asked Alex if he was okay. “That was awful,” Alex said. “Why’d they only do that to me and not anyone else?”

“I don’t know how they choose which people they do that to,” Adam said. “Sometimes it’s if they see something on that x-ray thing you walk through. I’m sorry you had to go through that. It’s not comfortable.”

“He kept touching around my… thing,” Alex said. “I think he could tell that it was… That I wasn’t normal.”

“You are normal,” Adam said. “Don’t convince yourself that you aren’t. You’ll never have to see that guy again.”

“Okay,” Alex said, but his chipper mood from earlier in the morning didn’t come back.

They sat down to wait for their flight. They’d arrived a little too early and were likely to be stuck sitting there for a while. After about half an hour, Alex stood up. “Adam, I need the restroom,” he said. “Please come with me?”

Adam knew that Alex absolutely needed to be accompanied to the toilet here. The airport was very crowded, and the restrooms were sure to be as well. The place was enormous, and it was very easy to get turned around and lose track of oneself. Alex’s confidence was no-doubt shot after the issue with security. Alex would be too nervous to go by himself to the restroom, and the likelihood of him getting lost in this gigantic building was high.

Adam noticed he was feeling a bit of pressure in his own bladder and would really like to relieve himself before their flight as well. And, in any other circumstance, he’d have no problem going off with Alex for a pee. But, that was not going to be easy here. They both had large suitcases, which were not allowed inside the restrooms, and which if left alone could be stolen or rifled through. They couldn’t go to the restroom together, if they did no one would be able to watch the luggage. Adam explained this to Alex, whom got a worried look on his face.

“I don’t think I can hold it all the way to Arizona,” Alex said.

“You won’t have to wait that long,” Adam promised. “There will be a toilet on the plane.”

“Oh,” Alex said. He looked relieved for a second, but then started bouncing his knees. “Um… How long until we can get on it?”

Adam checked his watch. “Not too long. Only about twenty minutes,” he said. “But, we can’t use the toilet as soon as we get on the flight.”

Alex’s worry obviously grew and his jiggling picked up speed.

“You’ll have to wait until after take-off. Once the seatbelt lights go off, you can get up and pee. It won’t be that long.”

Alex hoped Adam was right. Adam WAS usually right about things, though.

Soon enough, they were able to board their flight. Once they’d taken their seats, Alex was bouncing the tiniest bit. He wished he could have peed in the airport, but he understood why Adam had told him to wait. ‘You’ll get to go soon,’ he reminded himself, knees jiggling.

Adam noticed how antsy Alex was getting and felt a pang in his chest. Hopefully, Alex was just starting to feel nervous about flying. Adam felt terrible that he was making Alex hold it in longer than was comfortable for him. He patted a hand over Alex’s knee. “It will be okay,” he promised, still unsure if Alex’s squirming was from desperation or nerves.

Alex nodded, looking out the window. He was starting to get a little nervous about take-off, but not for the reason most people would. Alex’s bladder had become hard and swollen, and just turning too quickly in his seat was making the fluid inside of it slosh uncomfortably against his sphincters. He knew from past experience that being in a car or bus when he really, really had to pee was very unpleasant because each time the vehicle was jostled, the liquid Alex was containing would follow suit.

What did it feel like when a plane took off? Was that bumpy?

A few minutes later he learned that it was, indeed, VERY bumpy. He squeezed himself against his seat, hips shimmying and legs shaking. “Oooh—!” he whined out-loud. It felt like someone was repeatedly punching his bladder with all their strength!

Adam touched his knee softly again. “It’s okay,” he repeated, still hoping Alex was just scared of flying and NOT undergoing serious urinary distress. “It’s supposed to do that.”

Alex sucked in sharp breaths, his urine swirling and swishing angrily inside his body. “I have to go,” he whispered.

Adam’s heart sank. That WAS what was bugging Alex so much. He really HAD caused him to suffer. “I know, sweet thing,” he said. “I’m sorry. Just a couple more minutes, I promise.”

Alex hoped he could MANAGE a couple more minutes. The seatbelt he was still required to have fastened was cutting into the firm boulder in his center, trying very hard to tease out a leak. “O—Okay,” he said.

Adam kept rubbing Alex’s knee, realizing that his own knees were beginning to bounce. He’d been so worried about Alex this whole time he’d failed to notice how much his OWN need had grown. What had felt like a fluttery, annoying hum back at the airport was now a much more insistent, throbbing pinch. Once they could get up, he’d let Alex go first of course, but he definitely hoped Alex didn’t take too long in there.

As soon as the seatbelt light went off, Adam stood up and gestured for Alex to do the same. Alex followed him very gratefully, his bladder going a little bit looser already. “You can go first,” Adam said, trying not to squirm. “I only have to pee a little bit.”

Alex nodded and entered the restroom. It was a tighter squeeze than he’d thought it would be, and he didn’t usually like tight, constraining spaces. But, right now he needed to relieve himself so badly that he didn’t care. He unzipped and took aim.

Alex could kind of feel the plane moving beneath his feet, and to his dismay he felt his body retaining a lot of its tension. Enough tension, in fact, that his bladder was refusing to release its liquid. Alex was a little freaked out.

Alex was able to figure out that his tension was to do with the cramped space and the sensation of movement beneath his shoes. He couldn’t do anything about how tiny the room was, but he could at least stop feeling like he was going to fall over by changing his position a little.

Alex really, really hated sitting down to pee. It had always felt strange to him even before he knew he was trans. It made him uncomfortable to have to pay more attention to… that part of his body. Not to mention, and even he thought it was weird he felt this way, but the sound it made when he peed sitting down was intolerable to him. But, he had less reason to worry about falling over if he was seated, so he decided to try that. He wouldn’t pull down his harness though, he’d leave his STP right where it was and still urinate through it. Taking it off would feel wrong. It was a part of his body.

He sat down and waited for his flow to begin. It didn't though. He still felt that tension inside himself. He tried to push and force the stream to come, mindful of how Adam was anxiously waiting on him to finish up so he could go, but remembering that only seemed to make it even harder to relax! Then, the plane began to bounce violently again like it had during take-off. "Nnnh!" Alex cried out in shock, putting his hands against the walls, and—

Pssshhhhh!

—Losing control of his bladder.

Well. So long as something worked, he supposed he ought to be grateful for all the sudden bounciness. He allowed his eyes to drift shut, a smile spreading across his face as all the strain began to pour out of his body. Before he could release the relieved breath from his lungs though, there was a knock on the door. "Sir?" an unfamiliar voice said. "I apologize, but we've hit turbulence and you must return to your seat immediately."

'Immediately', Alex repeated to himself. Like, immediately immediately? But... He wasn't done yet! He'd only just started, there was still so much in him... He felt anxiety growing as he started to fear that he was breaking an important rule. Immediately meant immediately, didn't it? He cringed and whimpered as he forced himself to stop peeing when he still needed to so badly... When he stood and pulled up his shorts, a stubborn, final spurt seeped out into the material. Even though he'd been able to let it flow for about twenty seconds there, even though he'd gotten some of the burden out of his body, he now felt like he needed to go even worse than he had before he'd let out a drop.

Whimpering miserably as he cleaned off his hands, listening to the tortuous sound of the sink's running faucet, he finally left the restroom, feeling closer to an accident than ever before.

Alex returned to his seat. Adam was there and obviously not doing so well. He was fanning his knees in and out, allowing them to bounce. Adam had begun to feel a lot more desperate the whole time he'd been waiting outside the bathroom door, and when he had been told to go sit back down by the flight attendant, it was like a kick to his bladder. He was very scared now that he might not make it after all unless the turbulence ended very soon. at least Alex got to go, he thought. He didn't have to worry about that anymore.

Alex kept on leaking each time the plane jerked. He felt tears brimming in his eyes just from the pain alone. And then, the tears were going down his cheeks instead. 'It hurts,' he thought. 'It hurts, it hurts, it hurts!' He knew what relief had felt like from those few, sweet seconds in the restroom and he wanted that feeling back NOW. He'd never had to cut off a pee midstream like that before, especially not one he'd needed so intensely. His muscles were burning and felt like worn out rubber bands that had lost all their tension. "Hnnnnn" he muttered. "Can't hold it..."

Adam stopped shimmying and twisting for the briefest of seconds when he heard that. His brows knit in confusion. Bouncing up and down in his chair as he turned to face Alex, he asked "Can't... Alex, didn't you JUST go?"

Alex shook his head miserably. "Only... Only a little bit, I couldn't finish because they knocked on the door and said I had to go sit back down immediately."

Adam felt his heart clench and drop, until it felt like the weight of it was pressing atop his bladder. Alex had forced himself to cut off his flow right in the middle of a VERY urgent piss. Adam had ended up being interrupted midstream a couple times by something startling him and making him stop for a few seconds. But, it was only ever for a few seconds, he hadn't ever been stopped and then forced to carry on holding it for an undetermined length of time. "Alex... You could have finished, I'm sure they didn't mean you had to do that," he said.

Alex leaned back against his chair and stared at the ceiling, moaning as his hands dug between his legs, "I'm an idiot!"

"Hey, no," Adam said. "You're not. You got confused, and that's okay. It doesn't mean you're dumb. They shouldn't have said 'immediately', they should have said 'as soon as you're finished'." Adam felt like he was being over-dramatic now, twisting his hips back and forth needfully when he knew that Alex must have been a whole lot worse off...

Alex tightened his ankles around each other. “H—How much longer until I can go again?”

Adam frowned, chewing his lip. “I don’t know…” he admitted. “We have to wait for the plane to stop bouncing. Hopefully soon.”

Alex hoped so too. His bladder was still struggling to stitch itself back together again after the torment of being closed back up midstream. He didn’t understand it. Why did it feel like he had to go WORSE now? He’d peed a little, his bladder was emptier! He should have felt at least a tiny bit better!

The bouncing and shaking of the plane wasn’t helping him at all. Each bump drew forth a little whimper, his eyes growing watery. But, when the tears fell, his cheeks weren’t the only things getting wet. A dribble of pee was snaking its way out of his body, dampening his boxers and no matter how much he twisted around, he couldn’t make it stop, he could only slow it down. Fear clamped a fist around his body, squeezing hard into his bladder and threatening to turn the drips into an actual stream. “Adam—!” he whispered urgently. “I’m— I— I’m going a little…”

Adam squeezed Alex’s shoulder, trying to comfort him. “It’s— It’s okay. I’m sure it won’t be that much longer…”

Alex managed to stop his dripping for a moment, but before he could relax and convince himself his bladder was calming down, a spurt hissed out. And another. And another. “I— I can’t stop…” he told Adam. “I can’t— I need the restroom so bad, it won’t stay in!” his voice was getting quieter and quieter with every word, and he felt certain everyone else on the plane could hear him anyway.

Adam anxiously worried at his lip. Poor Alex was in such obvious agony, and Adam actually managed to HEAR it when one of his leaks jetted out. Alex’s hands were still wedged between the crease of his wriggling thighs, but they clearly weren’t enough to plug him closed anymore.

“I can— I can help you hold it,” Adam said. “Do you want me to?”

“Y—Yes, please,” Alex begged. He couldn’t hold it anymore, his bladder was too full, it couldn’t fit everything!

Adam pressed one of his hands between Alex’s legs, reinforcing the hold his boyfriend already had against his crotch. Adam squeezed as tight as he could.

Immediately, the relief of a THIRD hand jammed against his crotch was magnificent for Alex. Three hands were better than two. So much better. He moved silently closer to Adam, shifting and widening the angle of his thighs so Adam could get an even better grip. He leaned his head on Adam’s shoulder, taking shallow breaths.

“Helping?” Adam asked.

“Yes…” Alex mumbled out his gratitude. “Don’t let go.”

Adam didn’t let go, and as the turbulence continued, he ended up needing to press his other hand against his own groin, bucking himself against it. He kept his eyes fixed on the seatbelt light above them both, begging it to switch back off. He felt every shift in Alex’s hips, every time his thigh muscles tensed or spasmed. He knew the precise moments Alex’s bladder was upsetting him the most.

Finally, the light went off. The plane was flying smoothly again.

"Sweet thing," Adam said softly. "You can get up now, you can go." He was a little concerned about how Alex was going to walk to the toilet now, and imagined himself carrying him there, all the while hoping his own bladder didn't break apart at the added tension. But, when Alex shot to his feet at lightning speed, Adam thought that if he hurried, if he really, really hurried, he'd be okay. 'I NEED him to hurry...' Adam thought to himself. All through the torturous turbulence, his bladder had been knocked around as badly as Alex's had been, and he knew he had very little time left before he broke apart and lost it.

Alex moved as fast as he could to the restroom. There was no doubt in his mind he had to go worse than Adam did. He had to go worse than anyone on the planet had ever had to go at any point in history, for sure! His bladder was shrieking and screaming in intense agony that he couldn't stand to bear another second! He practically threw himself into the restroom and nosily turned the lock into place with one hand while the other yanked his zipper down and fished out his prosthetic.

He spun around, torturing himself a few moments longer as he ensured the cup of his STP was right where it needed to be-- Imagine going through all that suffering only to get a lot of pee in his clothes anyway because he hadn't positioned everything right!-- Once he was positive everything was okay, he didn't even need to tell himself to pee. It just happened. He was gushing an entire waterfall, the feeling of the plane in motion didn't stop him at all like it had done before. He was going, ohhhh, he'd needed this!

Just like before, his eyes drooped closed and he began to smile softly. "Mmmmmm..." he hummed out, tension flooding from his body and leaving nothing but wonderful, glorious emptiness behind. His stream pounding into the waterless toilet was extremely loud and if he'd been in a better frame of mind, that might have embarrassed him, but all he could even comprehend was how good this felt. He'd waited so long, almost too long, and now he just felt so, so much better.

This time, Alex was able to gush away until he was finally good and empty. He zipped up and opened the door, finding Adam standing beside it and squirming from head to toe. “I’m sorry…” he said. “I hope I didn’t take too long.”

“I—It’s fine,” Adam promised him, rushing into the restroom.

Alex didn’t go back to his seat yet, instead waited outside the door for Adam. He was able to hear some frantic rustling, followed by a strong hiss and relaxed moan. ‘Did I sound like that?’ Alex wondered, blushing.

Adam came back out a moment later and took Alex’s hand, leading him back to their row. “Ahhh, that’s better,” he said.

“I’m really sorry I made you wait,” Alex reiterated.

“Don’t worry about it, silly…” Adam said, stroking Alex’s hand gently. “I made it okay, you didn’t take too long.”

Written for the Omovember prompt "While Tied Up"

***

When Adam returned from the kitchen with a bag of chips, he immediately broke out laughing. “What in the world?”

He and Alex were baby-sitting Alex’s younger siblings today, and for some reason Charity and Prudence now had Alex laying on his stomach in the middle of the living room, with his hands tied behind his back.

Alex glanced up at his boyfriend. “They’re playing… Um…” he hesitated.

“We are playing ID Channel,” Charity informed brightly.

“Erm…” Adam kept staring. “The… Uh, the TV station with all the serial killer documentaries on it?”

Alex sighed. “They saw part of a show Grandma was watching,” he explained. “I don’t think they really understood it. I hope not, anyway.”

Prudence tied one more knot around Alex’s wrists. “There!” she said. “Done!”

Adam looked more closely now. “Where did you get shoelaces from?”

“Shoes,” Charity said.

Adam sighed. “Okay. But, WHAT shoes?”

“Mama’s.”

“Alright, don’t do that,” Adam scolded. “Use your own shoelaces.”

“Ours have velcro,” Prudence said. “We don’t know how to tie them yet.”

Adam looked from her to the knots now encasing Alex’s wrists. Those knots certainly weren’t how shoes were supposed to be laced, but they looked pretty sturdy, at least. Maybe TOO sturdy. “Alex? Can you move your fingers alright like that?”

Alex flexed them. “Yeah,” he said. “Don’t worry Adam, I said they could do this. It’s just a game.”

Adam wasn’t so sure how much he liked the idea of someone playing pretend serial killer with Alex, but if Alex was right and they really just hadn’t understood the context of whatever they’d seen in the documentary, he supposed it wasn’t TOO freaky. And Alex didn’t mind it, so that meant everything was fine, right?

“So, what do you do now that he’s all tied up?” Adam asked hesitantly.

Charity shrugged. “I dunno.”

“We didn’t see that part,” Prudence added. “Grandma spotted us and said to go back to bed.”

Adam nodded. That was probably for the best… Instead of having nightmares, they just ended up with an idea for a really weird game.

“We can tie Adam up too,” Charity suggested.

“No, I don’t think so,” Adam said.

“Awww…”

“Well, what if you can’t get the knots back out?” Adam explained. “Somebody has to untie Alex eventually, right?”

Charity nodded.

“But, you know what you could do?” Adam asked with a mischievous grin. “Alex IS super ticklish…”

“Wait—“ Alex began, but he stopped and his breath hitched when he felt fingers drumming against his side delicately. His body tensed and his teeth clenched as he tried to lock away the laughter bubbling up from within. “H—Hold on!”

Without stopping the movements of his fingers, Adam turned to Charity and Prudence. “See?”

The girls immediately joined in, assailing Alex’s other side. He jerked around, inadvertently just leaving more of his body susceptible to the touches.

Adam’s fingers crawled all over Alex, seeking out all his more sensitive spots, the ones that would result in more than just a tense jaw or a sharp inhale of breath. When his fingertips grazed beneath Alex’s armpit, Alex squealed loudly, causing the other three to laugh.

“Oh, wait,” Adam said, sticking his tongue out playfully. “Lemme show you the best spot!” he shifted across the carpet, down towards Alex’s shoes.

“Adam— Haha—!” Alex’s back arched as Prudence’s fingers wormed along his ribs. “No, don’t!”

Adam pulled off Alex’s shoes and socks, and right away his hands were scuttling all over the soles of his bare feet. Alex made another yelp, kicked his legs around wildly. But, Adam clamped a hand around one of his ankles, preventing him from moving any further. He focused now on skating his nails all around the sensitive sole of Alex’s foot, laughing up a storm as Alex squirmed and flailed.

Prudence and Charity giggled as they watched their brother struggle, watched as Adam’s fingers smoothed and glided over Alex’s foot, not leaving any part of the skin there untouched as they burrowed away. Alex kept laughing, kicking his one free leg.

“See?” Adam said to the girls. “If you really wanna bug him, go for the feet!” he said, moving up to Alex’s ankle and kneading the skin there like dough, drawing forth heavier and heavier bouts of laughter.

Alex was near tears as more and more giggles uncontrollably flew from his mouth, but as his sides kept heaving, he became suddenly VERY aware that something else was taking place inside his body— A rather uncomfortable reminder of all the water he’d had throughout the day. He knew right away that, if he didn’t get a handle on this situation, it wasn’t going to end well for him.

It was just so hard to get any words out with Adam mercilessly tickling his foot, and he couldn’t try to SHOVE Adam’s hands away when his OWN were still tied up.

“Adam— Hahaha!— St—Stop!! Heheh— I— have to— have to— Hahahaha—!!”

Alex’s efforts to speak were utterly futile, and as he felt his holding muscles start to tremble and surge with every bubble of laughter, he heard panicked blood begin to rush inside his ears. It didn’t help that he couldn’t control the movement of his lower body, he could feel his urine sloshing to and fro every time he jerked around.

“Adam—!” Alex cried out. “Adam— Hahaha— Enough! Th—That’s—“

Adam finally let go of Alex’s foot, still chuckling to himself. “Alright, alright…” he sighed.

Alex sighed too, relief flooding his body. His bladder suddenly felt MUCH easier to contain. “Adam, I have to—“ He looked up, seeing Prudence and Charity were no longer with them. “Um… Where did they go?”

“I guess they went to play something else,” Adam said. “I’ll go check on them and make sure they’re not causing trouble.”

“Okay, thank you,” Alex said, watching his boyfriend walk off. He laid there a moment longer, before the nagging demands from his bladder became more than he could tolerate. Wow, he had to GO. He was surprised he hadn’t noticed how full he was until Adam had started tickling him.

It wasn’t easy climbing back onto his feet without the use of his hands, but Alex managed it. As he’d expected, standing up after laying on the floor for so long prompted a few reactions inside his body. His legs were full of pins and needles after being kept in a stationary position for such an immense length of time, and he felt stinging and burning radiating all throughout them the instant he had managed to hoist himself up.

The flaring in his limbs absolutely couldn’t compare to the sheer, white-hot agony that thrashed its way through his bladder. The urine he was retaining surged with a new sense of fury now that it was being moved around so much more. It was like trying to carry a large, heavy bucket of water that had nearly been filled to the brim. It felt as though one wrong move could cause the contents to spill out over the top. “Ooof….” Alex flinched as he found himself on his feet. His knees rubbed together with urgency.

What he REALLY wanted to do was reach over and give himself a nice, long squeeze. He knew THAT would definitely help him feel a lot better. His hands were stuck though, no way to grab himself until they were untied.   Really, that was fine though. He was really close to a toilet, he knew that he’d be peeing soon enough. There was no need for him to panic.

He made it to the restroom a minute later. It wasn’t so easy getting the door shut behind himself with his hands trapped where they were, but he was able to pull it mostly closed with his foot. He stood in front of the toilet. He reached to lift the lid and seat and—

Oh. Right…

He turned AROUND and positioned himself so that his hands grazed against the lid. He grasped hold of it and fought to force it up. He couldn’t get much of a tight hold on the thing since his fingers had fallen asleep, and it kept shutting on its own each time he nearly got it opened all the way.

Finally, the bowl was available. Alex decided NOT to bother with lifting the seat, he’d just sit down this time. He didn’t care. This extra obstacle preventing him from urinating had seriously irritated the walls of his full bladder. It didn’t understand why he’d been in the restroom for SO long and still hadn’t emptied it!

He turned back around, needing to clench his thighs and stomp his feet a bit as he looked at the now-usable toilet. His urethra flared, his holding muscles burning as he told himself it would only be a few more seconds, and then he’d be able to relax.

He just had to unzip and pull down his—

Uh oh…

Alex jerked his hands about, trying to see if he could somehow wriggle one of them somewhere that was even CLOSE to his zipper, but he couldn’t. They stayed immobilized in the middle of his back. So, instead he decided to see if he could just grab the back of his waistband and pull his shorts down that way, but this too wasn’t possible. He couldn’t even get them to budge, his fingertips just fluttered against his waistband uselessly.

His bladder panicked before HE did, and it released the first hot, urgent dribble into his clothing. He winced, clenching hard and forcing the dribble to cease before it become a stream or a flood. His boxers were sodden now, the warmth taunting to all of the liquid that had not managed to escape from his bladder.

This was okay, he just… Needed to hold it a couple more minutes. Adam would untie him and then he’d be free to go. No big deal— If it weren’t for the fact that his need was approaching a CRITICAL level and he didn’t know how much longer he could wait…

He needn’t have worried though, because he soon heard a door across the hall open and Adam yelling out “They’re just coloring with Mary, they’re alright, Alex… Alex?”

“I’m in here!” Alex called back. “I have to— I really need to pee!”

Adam snorted. “Well, at least you’re in the right place for… Ohhhh, you need help, don’t you?” he realized. A moment later, he’d pushed open the door and had joined Alex in the restroom. He watched as Alex hopped urgently from one foot to the other, performing a pee-dance right in front of a perfectly functional toilet. “Awww… Poor thing,” he said. “Lemme get your hands for you…”

“Hurry!” Alex begged. “Hurry, please, please hurry!” His bladder was thoroughly enraged now, all that tickling and laughing had irritated it, and now being made to just stand there and LOOK at a toilet for so long was making it twist and tie itself in painful knots— Not unlike the ones wrapped around Alex’s wrist.

“I’m hurrying,” Adam promised. “This is because I tickled you so much, isn’t it?”

Alex let out a relieved breath as he felt Adam working at the shoelace entrapping his hands. “Y—Yeah,” he admitted, his bladder quivering inside of him at the memory. “But, I drank a lot too.”

“I’m sorry,” Adam said. His brows knit. “Er…”

Alex sucked in his stomach tight, that wasn’t a very pleasant sound to hear right now!

Adam squeezed Alex’s shoulder, sensing his panic. “It’s alright,” he said. “Just… Having a little trouble figuring out this knot.”

Alex’s bladder thrashed and he stomped his feet harshly against the tiled floor. He screwed his eyes shut tight, no longer wanting the taunting sight of the toilet right in front of him. “Nnnh…” he whimpered. He wished that he could at least be granted the ability to hold himself! But, if he could grab his crotch, that would mean at least ONE of his hands was usable, and if that were the case he’d actually be able to pee!

Adam kept fiddling with the shoelace, but it was like Prudence had quadruple knotted it or something, he couldn’t get it to loosen up even a little! And the longer Adam fought with THIS knot, the more knots seemed to appear in his boyfriend’s spine. “I’ll get it fixed, I promise!” Adam assured again. “I’ll— Hey, how about we cut it off with scissors, alright? That’ll get you out REAL fast!”

Alex was shaking his head already, legs twisting up even more than the shoelace. His thighs strained and rubbed together. “N—No, Mom might be upset if we cut it.”

Adam wanted to argue that she’d probably be alright with having a shoelace sliced in half if it meant her son hadn’t burst his bladder all over the floor, but decided against it. It was very hard to persuade Alex to break rules. “Okay,” he said. “I’ll just— I’ll fix it.” He kept working for several minutes, Alex gasping, rocking, jiggling and taking in sharp gasps the whole time.

At last, Adam managed to loosen the knot slightly, still not enough to slip Alex’s hands out, but it was progress! Before he could tell Alex the good news however, Alex shuddered hard and exclaimed “I— I can’t wait!“

“H—Hold it, Alex!” Adam encouraged. “Just a few more minutes, I’ve got it looser n—“

“I’m… No, I’m leaking!” Alex admitted softly. Another spurt had seeped into his boxers a moment ago. And then another. And another. He was having an accident, just much more slowly than he NEEDED to be. His whole body was tense as he fought to restrain the little gushes that yearned so badly to turn into a stream.

Adam froze, and realized they’d been going about this all wrong. Alex didn’t need HIS hands specifically, he just needed HANDS. Whom they belonged to was irrelevant. “Here, lemme help you…” Adam reached for Alex’s zipper and began to lower it down for him.

Alex’s eyes cracked back open when he heard and felt his zipper being moved. He felt silly too, now that he realized they’d overlooked such a simple solution.

He watched Adam lift the seat on the toilet, watched Adam free the head of his prosthetic and aim it for him, felt Adam pushing the cup firmly against him. “Everything feel like it’s in the right spot now, sweet thing?”

Alex started to nod, but the spray of urine that hissed into the bowl was answer enough. Alex’s body twitched with shivers as his muscles finally went loose and limp. “Ohhh, thank you…” he murmured gratefully. “Thank you, thank you…”

Adam looked at him and grinned, “Heh, you’re welcome,” he chuckled. “Shoulda done this from the start, sorr—“ he heard liquid pattering the rim of the bowl.

“Hey! W—Watch where you’re making me go!” Alex laughed.

Adam tilted his head back around, adjusting his grip on Alex’s cock so his stream landed where it belonged once more. “S—Sorry!” he said. “It just feels weird aiming for somebody else!”

“Heheh, it’s okay,” Alex said. “Thank you…” He pushed down, forcing out the last of his urine.

Adam watched it trickle into the bowl. “Done?” he asked. “That all of it?”

Alex nodded, “Yeah.”

Adam shook Alex’s cock a few times, getting out a final few spurts, then tucked it back into Alex’s shorts and zipped him up. He had the most peculiar urge to pat the top of Alex’s head now, to run a hand through his long hair. He settled for simply kissing him on the cheek instead.

Alex blushed. “Th—Thank you,” he said once more.

“You’re very welcome, it was MY fault you had to go so bad anyway,” Adam said. “All the tickling.” He stood behind Alex once more, and had a far easier time undoing the knot around his wrists now that Alex had stopped fidgeting.

Written for the Omovember prompt "In The Rain"

***

Whenever a thunderstorm happened, Adam was even more protective of Alex than usual. He hated seeing the poor guy trembling, hated hearing him yelp every time a clap of thunder sounded. He hated the way he’d gasp and struggle to breathe when a bolt of lightning lit up the sky. When a storm began in the middle of the day, Adam would find Alex and hold him on the couch until it passed, never getting upset when Alex’s nails dug into his skin.

Alex was always a lot more scared if a storm came at night, though. It made sense, when he’d been made to stand in harsh weather, it had always been overnight; The wind, the rain and the darkness creating terrifying shapes for him. Whenever thunder sounded in the night, Alex would press himself against Adam so tightly it was like he was trying to fuze them together.

Adam had gotten something that seemed to help Alex sleep a little better when the weather was frightening him. He’d purchased a white noise machine, which could mostly block out the sounds that scared Alex so badly. Alex would still cling onto Adam for dear life all night, but he’d at least be able to SLEEP eventually rather than staying awake half the night in fear.

But, there came a night when the white noise machine couldn’t help Alex relax at all. That night, it wasn’t just rain, thunder and lightning. Instead, it was ICE, thunder and lightning. The sound of the little shards of ice plinking against the windows and on the roof made Alex jump a few times. Adam held his hand as they sat on the couch. “Just a little ice,” he said, kissing him.

“What if it breaks a window, or—“

“So far, it’s just tiny chunks,” Adam said. “There’s no hail or anything, I doubt it can break a window. When it hits the window, IT’S breaking, I think that’s the crackling noise we keep hearing. You’re inside, you’re with me. It’s light and warm and dry, and nothing bad is going to happen to you.”

Alex inched even closer to Adam. “I— I know I shouldn’t be scared.”

“It’s okay to be scared,” Adam promised.

 “It’s a silly thing to be scared of…”

Adam shook his head. “No, I’d say you have a really good reason to be scared of storms,” he said. “You know what, though? I have a REALLY weird phobia— And I don’t even know where it CAME from! At least you know WHY you’re scared of thunder, right?”

“Wh—What’s your phobia?”

“It’s a little difficult to explain,” Adam said. “It’s like… I get REALLY freaked out and uncomfortable if I’m in a super wide area with nothing in it— Like a huge empty room or a big open field. You ever been in a grocery store that’s about to shut down? Most of the aisles are taken apart and there’s barely anything in there, so it’s just this enormous vacant space and it… It creeps me out. Actually makes me get all sweaty and itchy. And, like, I don’t even know what I think is gonna happen to me in a space like that, I have NO idea why it scares me. It just does. It’s like I’ve got the reverse of claustrophobia, I feel pretty safe in a tight enclosed space, but the opposite scares the heck outta me.”

“Hm…” Alex said. “You’d be a real bad astronaut then. Can’t think of a bigger void than outer space.”

“Yeah, I probably wouldn’t want to be out there,” Adam agreed. “So, yeah. I’m scared of something completely random even though I can’t think of why it’d ever hurt me. You’re scared of something that HAS hurt you before, so at least yours makes sense.”

“Aww, it’s okay if you’re scared of—“  

THOOM!

“Ahhhh!” Alex tensed up and wrapped himself around Adam, trembling as a huge crack of thunder sounded from outside.

“Shhh…” Adam soothed him, rubbing his back. “It’s okay, it’s okay… I’m right here, sweet thing. It’s okay.”

Alex continued to shake, refusing to look back up or let go of his boyfriend. Adam didn’t mind at all, just continued to stroke his body and whisper encouragements to him.

“You’re safe,” Adam said once more. “Nothing bad’s gonna happen to you. It’s okay, it’s okay… It’s—“

THOOM!

Another crash from outside. Then another. And another. And flashes of lightning that lit up everything outside the window, and—

VWIP!

Suddenly, the room was pitch-black, and the ever-present buzzing of the refrigerator in the kitchen was gone.

Adam froze, waited a moment.

The lights didn’t come back on.

Alex was still burying his face against his chest, “D—Adam, what’s—“

Adam rubbed him more. The apartment was cooling off rapidly, if the lights weren’t working, then that of course meant the heat wouldn’t work either. And it was below freezing outside. Hopefully the power came back before it got TOO cold. “Electricity went out,” he said softly.

Alex shook more. “Will it come back?”

“Yeah… Probably in a few minutes,” Adam said. “There’s just… A ton of lightning, maybe a tree branch fell on something. I’m sure somebody will fix it.” He wasn’t sure how long that would take, it surely wasn’t safe for someone to be outside working in this storm.

“Do we have to fix it?”

“No, they need people with special training to work on that stuff,” Adam said. “I’ve got no idea how the electricity works. I just know that if I plug my computer in, the wall makes it wake up somehow.”

“Eheh…” Alex tried to smile. “It’s… It’s so dark, Adam…”

“I know,” Adam said. “But, this is just our home. You know everything that’s in here. Worst that’ll happen to you is you hit your toe because you can’t see where you’re going.”

“Mmf,” Alex murmured. “I… I don’t like the dark, not when it’s thundering…”

“Shhh…” Adam whispered. “It’s close to bedtime anyway…” He thought it was, at least. He couldn’t remember when he’d last checked the time, and none of their clocks were going to be working without power. “Won’t matter that it’s dark.” He shivered… Wow, this apartment didn’t retain heat well at all! It already felt like it had dropped ten degrees in here!

“You scared, too?”

“A little,” Adam admitted. He was quite worried about the food in the fridge, if it stayed off for TOO long some of it might spoil. “But, mostly I’m cold.”

“M—Me too,” Alex said, squeezing Adam tighter. “You’re warm…”

Adam kissed him softly. “Let’s go to bed, get under the blankets, nice and cozy.”

They had some trouble getting to the bedroom. The apartment was small and they knew their way around it well, but the tight corners made it more likely for one of them to bump into something. Adam smacked his foot into the wall and yelped. “Oooff—!”

“You okay?” Alex asked.

“F—Fine, just hurt my foot a bit. It’ll feel better in the morning.”

They made it finally, and Adam felt around for their nightstand, then pawed through one of the drawers until his hand finally landed on something cylindrical. He flicked the switch and a small beam of light shone out. “O—Okay, found the flashlight,” he said.

Alex relaxed now that it wasn’t totally dark, but the light was dim and flickering. “Do we have more batteries for it?” he asked.

“No,” Adam said apologetically. “We’ll have to be careful how much we use it. But, it’s here at least.” He shined it at the bed and watched Alex climb in, then joined him. He grabbed Alex’s hand and squeezed before turning the flashlight back off. “Try to sleep some, sweet thing,” he said.

Alex nodded against his back, starting to shudder once more.

“Cl—Close your eyes, you won’t notice it’s dark,” Adam told him.

“I— I am… It’s still scary, and cold…”

Adam turned and wrapped his arms around Alex, pulling him in even closer. “We need to get more blankets…” he said. “Hopefully, I can be warm enough for you tonight.”

Alex nuzzled him. “Mmm… You’re toasty…”

“Heh, good…” Adam kissed him. “Just relax, I bet the lights and heat will be back by morning.”

“Hope s—“

THOOOOOOM!

A violent clap of thunder got Alex gasping in fright and clutching Adam hard enough to leave little imprints in his skin. “Ahhh—!”

“Shhh…Shhh….Shhh…” Adam tried to impart some more calm into him, but Alex wouldn’t stop shaking.

“D—Does the noise machine take batteries, or—“

“It needs to hook into the wall,” Adam said. “I’m—“ he paused. Alex just needed something to block the sounds outside, it didn’t HAVE to be the white noise machine specifically. “I’m… Gonna get up for a second so I can get you something.”

“Mmmnnnhhh…” Alex winced as Adam left the bed, but felt a little better when his boyfriend turned the flashlight back on.

“Just hold on, I think something else will help.” He opened the nightstand drawer again and had a much easier time finding what he was looking for this time with the aid of the flashlight. He pulled out his old iPod and turned it on— Good, the battery was still charged.

He scrolled through it. “Okay, rock music isn’t a good thing to listen to if you’re trying to sleep,” he said. “How about… Right, I have a few audiobooks on here too. It can be like a bedtime story, I guess.” He looked through the list. Alex probably didn’t want to listen to a Dystopian story when he was already scared… True crime DEFINITELY wasn’t a good choice for him… He landed on a romance book he’d been obsessed with as a kid. Probably wasn’t as good as he remembered it— Honestly, the main thing he could even still recall about it was how he felt like he was really pulling one over on his parents by listening to a book that contained one extremely tame sex scene. “Alright, this one’s a love story,” he told Alex. “Let’s try listening to it instead of the storm.”

Alex nodded, he took the earbud Adam gave him and stuck it into his ear. Adam put the other one into his own ear and pressed play on the book. He’d listened to this story lots of times when he was younger, and as it began more of the details came back to him. He felt Alex starting to breathe easier beside him now that he had a distraction, and soon both of them had fallen asleep.

***

Adam’s eyes slowly cracked open. He still heard the audiobook playing in his ear, still felt Alex’s soft, warm body heating him up, still felt cozy. As his eyes opened further they went straight to the clock on the nightstand, Adam hoping so much that he’d see numbers flashing on it instead of blankness.

No such luck.

The power was still gone.

The apartment was a whole lot colder now. Alex’s body and the blankets were the only thing keeping Adam from trembling. The apartment was still eerily quiet. It was so strange how many little background noises Adam hadn’t even noticed until they were suddenly gone, like the hum of the refrigerator. The apartment was still pitch black, and while he had no way to know what time it actually was, he knew it was still the middle of the night. There wasn’t even any natural light pouring in through the window anymore. He couldn’t see a thing.

The last thing Adam wanted to do right then was get up. He didn’t want to leave the warmth of the blankets and his boyfriend, and he knew that his blindness would cause him to bump into something and maybe get hurt. But, a thrum from his bladder told him he NEEDED to get up very soon, otherwise he was going to warm the bed up in a new, and totally unpleasant, way. He’d been so focused on making Alex feel safer that he hadn’t peed before bed, and his bladder was going to make sure he paid the price for his negligence now.

Alex was squeezing him super tight though, he couldn’t shimmy out of his grasp without waking him up. He told himself not to worry too much about that, though. With how often he and Alex would simultaneously realize they were bursting for the toilet, he was sure Alex would be waking up to a full bladder of his own any second now.

Sure enough, a couple minutes later, he felt Alex starting to fidget roughly against him, and heard him sleepily mumble into his neck; “Adam, I need the bathroom now… Is the electricity back?”

“I gotta go too,” Adam said, beginning to writhe. He felt like his abdomen was stretching out. He was certain that, if he was ABLE to see anything, then if he looked down he’d see a painful, urgent bump right in his center. “And, sorry, it’s still not back.”

Alex groaned, opening his eyes more. He squeezed his legs together. “Adam, um… I can’t see anything… And I don’t think this can wait until the sun’s back out.”

“It REALLY can’t,” Adam agreed. Cringing, he shot a hand out from underneath the blankets, goosebumps instantly forming on his arm now that it was exposed to the cold air. He flinched, thinking about how he was going to have to do that to his whole body in a couple seconds. This was one of those times he wished his bladder had come with an off switch, it was so horribly inconvenient to have to empty it out right now. His hand fumbled and groped along the nightstand until he finally felt something hard and cylindrical. It was either one of his and Alex’s vibrating prosthetics, or the flashlight. When he felt the switch, he knew it was the flashlight and turned it on.

The batteries really WERE starting to run out, and the light it provided was very minimal and dim, but it was better than nothing. Adam knew they also needed to try to conserve it, since he didn’t have any more of the kind of battery the flashlight took. He shined it at Alex, whom squinted for a second and then looked relieved.

Adam slowly got out of bed, wanting to savor his last few seconds of relative warmth before he was flung into the icy cold, and dreading the effect that standing up was sure to have on his need for the toilet. As expected, once he was on his feet, the shift in gravity caused his bladder to cramp angrily, pressure pounding right at his opening. But, what he hadn’t expected was what the sudden shock of cold was going to do to him. He shivered violently, and his bladder just… contracted. It squeezed in on itself, like someone had wrapped their whole fist around it and had tried to juice it like an orange. A spurt squirted out of him and the hand not holding the flashlight went straight between his legs. “Hnng!” He’d never felt such an intense and sudden bout of physical discomfort hit him like that; a double whammy of feeling as though he was about to turn frozen solid and feeling like he was milliseconds away from peeing his pants.

Alex, whom had been moving slowly in order to better accommodate his bladder, picked up his pace when he saw the panic flit across Adam’s face. Adam, whom had been so calm through this stressful situation, was starting to freak out, and Alex wanted to comfort him. Once Alex was beside him, body shuddering and teeth chattering, knees knocking together as a flood of pee knocked so harshly against his dam, he said; “Oh, Adam, it’s okay! You said there’s nothing to be scared o—“

“I’m not scared,” Adam managed through a grunt. “I’m just super cold and I really, REALLY gotta pee, like right now.”

Now that he was close enough, Alex could see where Adam’s hand was in the shadows. Alex had thought HE was bursting, but it looked like Adam was even worse off than him. He was surprised Adam hadn’t ran to the toilet straight away and had instead chosen to wait for him.

Now though, Adam was in an obvious rush, he hurried from their room, then stopped, remembering he held the flashlight and Alex needed it to be able to see. He jumped in place as he waited for Alex to catch up, then forced himself to move alongside his partner at his slower pace.

Alex wasn’t TRYING to move so slow! He didn’t WANT to make Adam wait even longer for his sake, but it was SO hard for him to walk fast when he had to go like this! That was one of the worst parts about being desperate for Alex; He always wanted to RUN as fast as he could to the nearest toilet, but moving his legs so quickly and erratically would guarantee an accident. So, he would be forced to DRAG his poor bladder step by awkward, tiny, slow step, prolonging his agony even more.

They made it down the hall to the restroom and when Alex looked at Adam, his chest hurt. Alex felt like he was going to explode, but Adam looked like he was already starting to! He was doubled over, his knees rubbing together. “Sw—Sweet thing,” Adam said. “I— I’m so sorry, I know it’s really bad for you, but I just HAVE to go first.”

Alex was confused, about to remind Adam that they could just go TOGETHER like they did all the time. There was no reason either one of them needed to keep holding it right now.

“And— And I need you to hold the flashlight so that I can—“

Alex understood then. They needed light so that they could aim, and neither one of them was able to aim with one hand while the other was busy doing something else. So they couldn’t pee together this time. And while it was true aim wouldn’t be a problem if they sat down to go instead, there was no way both of them could fit on the seat. That would probably cause an even bigger mess than trying to aim blindly would.

Alex bit down on the whine building up in his throat, the one that wanted to cry “But, I really, really need to go!” Because, even in the dim light the flashlight granted them, he could see the way the crotch of Adam’s pants was darkening. He was losing control, and Alex hadn’t even sprung his first leak yet. Even though Alex wanted to pee SO bad, he knew Adam needed it even more than he did, and that Adam also needed HIM right now. “O—Okay…” Alex said, unable to stop himself from adding “Please go fast, though? Please? If you can?”

Adam nodded quickly, trying not to feel bad when he saw how rapidly Alex was bouncing. “I’ll hurry, I’ll hurry.”

“And—And don’t go directly into the water? So it’s quieter?” Alex requested, squeezing his thighs and rocking on his feet. “If it’s real loud, I think I’m gonna—“

“Oka—“ Adam was interrupted by a loud hiss of liquid splattering the inside of his boxers. Wordlessly, he thrust the flashlight into Alex’s hand and stumbled to the toilet, loudly slamming the lid and seat up. Ordinarily, he unbuttoned his pajama pants and pulled his prosthetic out through the hole, but the button was so fiddly he had no time for it. He just yanked his pants down and let them pool around his ankles. His legs instantly felt like they were made of ice shards, and he shivered harshly, his bladder reacting with that agonizing, squishing ache once more.

Pee burst from his tip and he could tell he’d missed from the sound, painfully, he clamped off his flow, “Alex! Light now!”

Alex rushed over and angled the flashlight so it was pointing at Adam’s dick and the toilet bowl in front of him, “G—“

A satisfyingly strong jet of pee erupted from Adam then, pounding right into the water. Before he could let out an ecstatic moan at the feeling, Alex loudly whimpered and jiggled so much that the flashlight’s beam went off in all directions. “Adam— Ah—!”

Adam quickly corrected himself so his pee was landing to the side of the water instead of directly into it. His stream wasn’t nearly as noisy then, but it was still hissing enough to make Alex nibble on his lip and shift his weight. “Mmm…” Adam sighed, giving in to his relief.

“Ohhh!” Alex moaned. He knew Adam was not trying to tease him, but having to hold it in while listening to him vocalize how wonderfully good he felt… Having to stand there and LOOK at his clear, hearty stream pouring away so that he was sure he was keeping the flashlight angled right… It made Alex feel like he was being punished.

Adam had been shivering constantly since leaving the bed, but as his pee picked up speed, he felt a different kind of shiver tear through him. One that was much more pleasant and made him feel weak at the knees. It felt so good his eyes rolled back in his head a little. Adam rarely got pee shivers like that, but when he did they felt intensely wonderful. He remembered all of the countless times he’d seen Alex shiver while urinating and actually felt a little jealous that Alex got to feel that happen so often.

Alex was grinding his teeth and thighs together simultaneously. The longer Adam’s pee went on, the more Alex felt like his OWN pee would be streaming into his pants soon. He’d begun to leak, he wasn’t even sure when it had started, but he felt the space between his legs becoming more and more saturated by the second. He was trying so hard not to guilt Adam for this, not to make him feel bad for doing what he had to do… But before long he couldn’t stop the words from pouring out, “Adam! Hurry up! I’m gonna—“

Before Alex could finish his beg, the most wonderful thing happened.

No, Adam did not finish peeing. He honestly didn’t feel CLOSE to done yet.

But, there was a brief flash of light above them. Then a flicker. And another. And then… The light was on! Immediately, there followed a quiet hum as the electronics in the apartment started to come back to life, and—

Alex dropped the flashlight on the ground and started to tear down his pants, “M—Move over, Adam…” he choked out, but he hadn’t needed to. As soon as the light was back on, Adam had stepped to the side, giving Alex enough space to join him.

Alex tipped his head back and panted heavily as his own stream began cascading into the bowl. His eyes squeezed themselves shut, his mouth hung open, and the shivers Adam envied him for began to ripple through his body.

As Alex’s pee started to pick up, Adam’s finally slowed down. A few more spurts trickled forth and he was at last nice and empty. He stepped back and pulled up his pants, noting how much looser they suddenly felt now that they weren’t squeezing against a tight ball of piss. Still breathing a little heavily, he watched as Alex, pink in the face, struggled to catch his breath as a geyser sprayed out of him. And then he felt a little bad. He knew he hadn’t really been able to help it, but he HAD still caused Alex to feel pained for a little extra while.

And then, he did something that not even he had been expecting. He hadn’t thought about doing it, hadn’t made any conscious decision, he just… Did it. He stood behind Alex, and started to hold him as he continued to relieve his bladder. “Sweet thing, I’m so sorry I did that to you,” he murmured softly.

Alex went even pinker. He thought back to the night in the tent where Adam had held him as he peed because he just felt so scared that he’d needed that extra bit of comfort. But, there was nothing scaring him now, not since the electricity had come back. Being held right now didn’t feel… bad. Quite the opposite, the relief of the gallons of pee trickling from his body mixed with the warmth of Adam’s body and the fuzziness that his touches filled Alex’s heart with was…Honestly one of the most gloriously magnificent things he thought he’d ever felt in his entire life.

“Uh—Um…” Alex managed between breathy sighs. “Don’t be sorry. You couldn’t help it.”

Adam then did something else neither of them expected, he nuzzled against Alex’s neck and kissed him gently there. “Thank you,” he said.

Alex finished peeing a moment later, leaned back hard against Adam, “You’re welcome…”

Written for the Omovember prompt "Scared/Surprised Into Wetting."

***

“Alex, are you absolutely positive that you want to do this?” Adam asked. “You don’t have to if you don’t want to. I won’t be upset, Camille won’t be upset, I—“

“I want to,” Alex assured. “Papa never let us do ANYTHING for Halloween growing up. We couldn’t even just buy candy at the store and eat it at home.”

Adam had done plenty of activities for Halloween when he was a kid— It was one of his favorite times of year because he could dress up and be whatever he wanted for one night. He still had fond memories of being five and wearing the costume of one of his favorite male cartoon characters. His parents then took him to a party with some of Dad’s work friends, and all the other kids there assumed right away that he was a boy, just like any other. Every time he heard one of them call him “he”, he’d feel happy inside.

Before Adam had met Alex, he had no idea that some people had different opinions about Halloween. Before Adam had met Alex, he’d never heard anybody refer to the holiday as being Satanic or a form of Devil worship. But, that was what Alex’s Father had said any time it was brought up. He’d even told Alex that, if he wore a Halloween costume, he would be inviting the Devil to change his identity— Opening himself up to demonic possession as Halloween was the day that the barrier separating the world from Hell was at its weakest.

So, Alex began to dread and fear October 31st while he was growing up. Papa would warn him that dangerous demons lurked around every corner that day, and that he had to be EXTRA careful so that they wouldn’t take control of him and cause him to go to Hell. Candy and fun costumes were just the demon’s method of tempting someone into letting them in.

Alex was surprised to learn that his new church held a trick-or-treating event of its own, and treated the days surrounding Halloween as a time to honor the dead…

“I used to be scared because of the things Papa told me,” Alex said. “But, there’s nothing in The Bible that says demons will possess you for eating sweets— Honey was even a symbol for good health. All of that must have just been more stuff Papa said so that we’d do what he wanted. So, there’s nothing to be scared of.”

Adam was glad Alex wasn’t scared of Halloween in general anymore, but he still wasn’t so sure about their plans for the evening. He understood Alex must have felt pretty left out, having never been able to dress up and get big sacks of candy before, he just didn’t know if this would be the best way to make up for those lost years. “I’m just saying, if you want to wear a costume and eat some candy, I’ll be fine with doing it together at home tomorrow instead. You don’t have to go to the haunted house to be able to do that.”

“I want to go, though,” Alex said. “Should I not?”

“I just don’t want you to get too scared,” Adam explained, recalling how clingy and terrified Alex got any time he saw a horror movie. He could already predict that being INSIDE the scary place, rather than looking in on it through a TV screen, would freak Alex out a lot. He could already predict that Alex would be grasping onto him and shuddering from the moment they walked through the door, and that he’d remain glued to him until they were out— And probably for a while afterwards, too.

Adam certainly didn’t object to having Alex press himself so closely to him, but knowing he was only doing so because he was scared out of his mind would make it less enjoyable.

“I know I’ll be scared,” Alex said. “But, you’ll be there to protect me, right?”

“Yes, of course,” Adam told him. “But… Are you sure?”

Alex nodded.

“Okay,” Adam said. “But, if we get there and you’re too scared to go in— Or if you want to leave early— that’s okay. We can stop whenever you want. I won’t be annoyed.”

Alex hugged him, he now felt certain that the haunted house wouldn’t be TOO big of a challenge for him at all.

***

Adam and Alex got out of their car and looked around for Camille. They spotted her quickly, as she was dressed in a very eye-catching mermaid costume with a tail that shimmered even with the setting sun. She rushed over to them excitedly. “Oh, Adam, I love your costume,” she said. “You look like you came out of an old movie.”

Adam was dressed as a 1920s-era mobster. “Heh, yeah… Um, since my real mustache isn’t growing in as fast as I wanted, I thought I’d dress up as something with one… Except now the fake mustache doesn’t wanna stay on, either.”

Camille laughed, lowering her voice. “I wish I could give you the hairs that keep trying to show up on my face. You wouldn’t even have to trade me anything for them.” She turned to Alex, taking in his angel costume. “Oh, you look good, too.”

“Actually,” Adam said. “I just took off his human disguise for tonight. Don’t tell anyone.”

Camille rolled her eyes exaggeratedly. “Ugggh…You two are gonna give me diabetes! Stop that!”

Adam laughed, and the three headed out of the parking lot together. Adam wiped some sweat off his brow. Since it was getting late, it wasn’t even that warm out, but the pinstripe suit he had on as his costume had multiple layers, and he was getting hot underneath them all.

Luckily, there was a concession stand set up before they reached the line for the house, so Adam was able to grab something to drink. He ordered one for Alex as well, and a moment later he was presented with two enormous, clear plastic cups filled with red slush dotted with ice. He was a bit surprised by the size considering the low price, he couldn’t remember ever seeing cups that big before.

But, he WAS incredibly thirsty, so he wasn’t going to complain. He grabbed them both and got in line beside Alex and Camille. He handed off one of the cups to Alex before sucking at the straw for his own oversized beverage.

“Oh, you got one for HIM but not me,” Camille said. “I see how it is…”

Adam blushed, pausing in his drinking for a moment. “S—Sorry. I only had two hands… I can go get you one, if you want!”

“It’s fine,” Camille laughed. “I’m just teasing you.”

“Heh, alright,” Adam relaxed and got back to work on draining his massive drink, downing obscenely large gulps of the semi-frozen liquid. Even once his thirst had been thoroughly quenched, he continued because the slushy was just so irresistibly delicious.

Alex drank his cup as well, but much slower than Adam— He was recalling the painful brain-freeze he’d experienced the first time he’d tasted a slushy, and was wary of repeating it.

Before long, Adam had tossed aside the straw in favor of lifting the cup’s lid and tilting his head back, gulping the chilly drink down until the cup was bone-dry. He smacked his lips a few times, glancing around until he found a recycling bin. “Hold on,” he told his friends.

As he left the line to dispose of the empty cup, Adam felt a little bit of pressure it his middle, an annoying little tingle reminding him that the huge drink he’d just consumed was going to have to come back OUT of him eventually.

Even when he looked back and forth and wasn’t able to locate any sort of restroom, he didn’t see any reason to worry. He was sure there WAS a place for him to go around here somewhere, and he only barely felt the urge right now, anyway. He’d be okay.

He returned to the line next to Alex, whom offered him the remainder of his own slushy. “I saw you getting all sweaty before,” he said. “So, you can finish this if you want.”

Adam took it, and began to suck down yet another bucket of flavored ice-water.

Alex listened to him guzzle, nervously smoothing a hand over his stomach. In truth, he’d INTENDED to finish the slushy all on his own, but a couple minutes ago a terrible thought had entered his brain; The slushy would make it to his bladder eventually, and he was about to go inside a place that was sure to frighten him. And sometimes when Alex got a bit too scared, he tended to—

Well. Alex didn’t want to tempt fate today. He wanted to make it through the haunted house so he could feel proud of himself for facing the terrifying things inside of it. He was sure to feel a lot LESS proud if, overloaded on liquid, he let himself get so startled that he peed a waterfall down his legs in public. He knew the odds of him wetting himself would be significantly LOWER if he DIDN’T drink a huge barrel of liquid before going in there.

Besides, Adam seemed to LOVE the flavor of that drink, and it made Alex feel good to watch him enjoy more of it.

When they were about halfway through the line, Adam had reached the bottom of the second mega-sized cup. He sighed and rolled up the sleeve on his suit to check the time. Impressive! He’d finished ALL of that in under an hour!

He was LESS impressed with himself when he stepped out of line to recycle the second cup. Each step towards the bin sent urgent signals through his abdomen, and he could FEEL the way the fluid sloshed back and forth inside his gut. He nibbled on his lip, trying to soothe his bladder now that he’d woken it up by walking around so much.

He tossed out the cup and spun around for a few seconds, looking in all directions for a sign that indicated where he might be able to find a toilet. But, there wasn’t one. ‘Are they all near the exit of the haunted house?’ he wondered, clenching his thighs and bobbing in place. He kept that up until the most severe pangs of his desperation passed, leaving him with just a hearty throbbing pressure.

‘It’s okay, we’re almost through the line,’ Adam reminded himself. ‘Gonna be annoying to do the whole house when I gotta piss, but no big deal. I’m sure there’ll be someplace for me to go afterwards. I can wait that long.’

Adam got back in line with his friends, crossing his legs slightly in one direction, and then the other. He hoped the rest of their waiting time would pass quickly.

It didn’t, of course. Everything felt much, much SLOWER now that Adam was so eagerly anticipating a restroom break. His bladder was stretching at a very alarming rate, too. This wasn’t too shocking— He DID just drink two huge barrels of slush in under an hour, of course that was going to fill him up. Still, the rate at which his urge was turning into a NEED was a bit frightening.

They’d moved forward twice so far, and in that time the throbbing tingles beneath Adam’s navel had already transcended into harsh, painful, jolting spasms that made him cross his legs at the ankles and palm gently against the fly of his suit. If Camille or Alex turned to look at him, he’d straighten himself out painfully and pretend he was merely trying to get the suit to look smoother.

He anxiously bounced on his heels and fiddled with the feather atop the hat he was wearing, trying his hardest to keep either of his hands from going back to his groin. All the daylight had nearly faded away now, and he was looking forward to when the sun would sink the rest of the way below the horizon; Once it was darker, he’d be able to squirm more unnoticed.

Adam tugged at the material of his pants, twisting in place and counting the people still ahead of them. His bladder convulsed harder and harder, and he dearly wished that this was a line for a toilet instead. That was probably the worst part, knowing that even once he was at the front of this line, he was STILL going to have to hold it in for a while longer.

Alex turned to face Adam when they got closer to the front. Worry was clear on his face. “H—How bad do you think it’s gonna be?”

And then Adam remembered the thing he SHOULD have been focusing on; Ensuring that Alex didn’t get too scared here. “J— Just keep in mind that nothing in there is r—real, okay?” he told him. “I—It’s all just props and make-up, and— Oh! Alex, you don’t have problems with flashing lights, do you? There are usually some of those in haunted houses, I don’t want you to get—“

“I’ve never had a problem before,” Alex said. “But, I’ve never been around many flashing lights before, either…”

“I—If they give you pr—problems, tell me, okay?” Adam said. “B—Because sometimes th—that can make people sick, and—“

Camille snorted beside them. “If I didn’t know better, I’d say YOU were more anxious about this than Alex is!”

Adam looked away, blushing. He supposed that he could be a little… Over-protective sometimes…

“If I wanna leave, I’ll tell you,” Alex promised. He eyed Adam for a moment. “Are YOU okay? You’re shaking…”

Adam nodded. They were too close to the front of the line now for him to leave and try to find a spot to pee, so he was just going to have to hold it back and hope that there was a toilet by the exit. “I’m alright,” he said. “Just excited, th—that’s all.”

Camille was watching him too. “You sure? You’re shuddering and stammering. I’ve never seen you get scared at one of these things before, what gives?”

“N—Nothing!” Adam insisted. “I’m fine… Um… Maybe I had too much slushy, and it’s giving me the chills!” He laughed anxiously, the walls of his full bladder shaking. That explanation had been a little bit TOO close to the truth.

Alex nodded and gripped one of Adam’s hands tightly. He felt more wary now that he was growing more certain Adam was frightened of the haunted house as well. These things must have been REALLY scary if even Adam was getting nervous! Butterflies twisted inside Alex’s stomach, and alerted him to a slight pressure just below it.

Oh no! Alex HAD had too much of that slushy, he had to use the restroom now. Not super badly, but bad enough that he couldn’t ignore it now that he’d noticed it. He chewed his lip, squeezing Adam’s hand even tighter. What if he got super scared in there, and then he wasn’t able to hold it? He’d have to walk back to the parking lot in wet clothes! Everyone would see and think he was a baby that couldn’t handle a little fright!

He clenched his thighs together, hoping that maybe if he focused REALLY hard on holding it while he was in there, then even if he DID get startled badly, he would maintain control over his bladder.

That should work, right?

Finally, their group was next in line. Adam breathed out a sigh of relief, even though he knew the door in front of them DIDN’T lead directly to a toilet. It still meant he was at least one step closer to one He tightened his hand around Alex’s. “R—Ready?” he asked him.

Alex hoped he was— He REALLY hoped that his BLADDER was. “Y—Yeah,” he said.

***

The haunted house was held in a building that used to be part of a college campus. Some of the original fixtures were still intact, like the drinking fountains and, to Adam’s dismay, some of the urinals were still there as well. Tacked uselessly to the wall, not hooked up to any sort of plumbing, not able to grant Adam any sort of relief. Just… Sitting there, taunting him.

The only saving grace was that he couldn’t really see them THAT well as he, Alex and Camille wandered through the room— It was pretty dark, a fog machine had been turned on, and cobweb props were placed everywhere as well.

Adam was still relieved to leave that room and move onto the next, where they encountered their first jumpscare in the form of a man dressed as a zombie popping out at them from behind a corner. Adam flinched slightly, and felt Alex’s grip on his hand become even tighter, before it went loose again a moment later.

Alex was feeling super proud of himself now. He had neither screamed nor lost a spurt from his bladder when the zombie had startled him. He’d jumped, but instinctively tensed his thighs at the same time, so he remained totally dry. His bladder was little more than a mild irritation now. He was constantly aware that he needed to pee, but felt confident that if he didn’t let himself freak out TOO badly, he’d be alright!

And he’d made it past one scare already, that meant he could probably handle the others, too!

Next they were moving through a long, shadowy corridor, and Alex felt a bit of dread welling up inside himself again. He squeezed Adam’s hand again, just to remind himself that he was there and would always keep him safe.

WHRRRR!

A zombie holding a chainsaw jumped out in front of them, leering. Alex clutched onto Adam as he stumbled back, trying to ignore the way Camille laughed.

Oh no— What if she was laughing because he’d—

A moment later, when his terror faded, Alex could confirm that there wasn’t any dampness between his legs, and his bladder was still tingling with the need to pee. He hadn’t gone. He was still holding it.

“You’ll get yours tonight!” the zombie growled out as Alex and his friends ran clumsily away.

And then, Alex was laughing too. He giggled and gasped in Adam’s arms, leaning hard into him. “Heheh, th—this is fun!” he said as he and Adam got a little more untangled from each other.

This area was lit up a little better, and Alex could SEE Adam more clearly. He saw a pinched expression on his boyfriend’s face, and a shudder working through his spine. Thinking Adam was actually a whole lot more scared now than HE was, Alex clasped his hand again for comfort. “You okay?”

“Y—Yeah,” Adam said nervously. Inside him, his bladder was doing cartwheels. He’d run WAY too quickly down that hallway, and it felt like he’d managed to knock the overfull organ out of its proper place or something. He felt the pressure absolutely EVERYWHERE now. Like, his body was trying so hard to find a place to cram the massive slushys he’d stupidly guzzled that now the liquid was flooding into his bones. He didn’t realize he was hopping from foot to foot until Camille made a comment.

“You sure you’re alright?” she asked him. “You’re really jumpy… You don’t usually—“

“I guess I’m a little more on edge tonight,” Adam admitted, still not wanting to say WHY. If he said why, Alex or Camille would probably say they should leave right away, and after they’d spent so long waiting in line, Adam didn’t want to cut this short just because he had to pee.

“Well, I promise I’M okay,” Alex said. “So, you don’t need to worry about me…”

Adam leaned into him, still shaking from the thundering roars of desperation that were pulsing nonstop beneath his fly.

With that, they moved on. Alex continued to mostly stay in control of his fear, he’d yelp, jump and cling onto Adam hard enough that his nails left imprints in his boyfriend’s skin, but beneath the fear was always a hint of excitement and fun— This was an enjoyable kind of scary, which was something Alex hadn’t known existed before!

Most importantly, Alex was also staying DRY. His need for the toilet had increased considerably in all the time they’d been walking through the house, he now felt his opening sting if he moved too quickly, but he worked hard to keep his sphincters closed and they continued to LISTEN— No matter how startled he got!

But Adam wasn’t having as easy a time with that. His body shook hard as he fought to ignore the very insistent call of nature, bending at the waist and rubbing his knees together. His lower half was trembling and straining, his best line of defense little more than a narrow ring of overworked, burning muscles, begging for permission to relax.

They rounded a corner and found themselves in Adam’s LEAST favorite part of any haunted house— The hall of mirrors. He wasn’t good with these, he always bumped into the walls, the reflections confusing him. To make it worse, this one had set up a flashing strobe light that flicked on and off each fraction of a second. Those lights disoriented Adam worse than ANYTHING. Trying to navigate this area with an absolutely OVERFLOWING bladder wasn’t going to be easy.

Camille was giggling as they entered the room. She knew how much Adam HATED this part, and always laughed as she watched him crash against his own reflection over and over again. He’d hoped for a moment that she might take pity on him and lead the way this time— She was so much better at this— but, of course she didn’t.

Adam kept shutting his eyes tightly against the irritating, flashing lights and the brutal pressure knotting inside his body. He barely remembered to ask Alex; “Are you okay? The lights aren’t making you feel dizzy, are they?”

“They’re annoying,” Alex said. “Er— I think YOU’RE the one getting dizzy! Keep your eyes closed, I’ll lead.”

“Aw, don’t let him just quit like that!” Camille said.

Alex didn’t listen to her, instead helping his dazed boyfriend navigate the room. With each bright flash of light, Alex was able to get a clearer view of how tense Adam was. He seemed to be struggling to walk, his knees bowing inwards and his feet stumbling multiple times. Alex tried to find the exit as fast as possible so he’d feel better.

That became more difficult when another zombie appeared, giggling darkly at them. “You’re never gonna get out of here! Give up now!”

Alex flinched and wrapped his hands around Adam’s arm more, his heart pounding rapidly and his bladder— His bladder shuddered and cramped, a harsh pressure flaring at his opening, pee right at the very edge of breaking out of its prison. He tensed his muscles up hard and stopped his leak just in time, hurrying to the mirror maze’s exit with Adam. “O—Okay!” he said once they were back in another tiny, almost pitch black corridor. “No more flashing lights!”

Adam opened his eyes. It was hard to tell in the dark, but he didn’t appear to relax very much.

Adam was still shuffling like crazy, fighting hard against the flood he had so stupidly created with his impulsive chugging of those slushys.

And those slushys were STILL not finished working through him yet! His kidneys were STILL pumping more and more fluid into a bladder that was already filled to its absolute BRIM. It pushed painfully against his hip bones, like it was trying to break him apart. He could hardly breathe around the horrid weight inside him, and— And he needed to go NOW, he was going to explode! “O—Oh…. Alex, I need—“

Suddenly a slap was heard against the wall, and Adam jolted. “No one can help you now!” a voice hissed out. “You’re trapped in here with me!”   And then there was a hand on his ankle, a weird, slimy one, and it was getting tighter, and Adam yelped and—

Then he felt it. For a single, solitary second, Adam felt his crotch grow warm with a quick jet of piss. He was overcome by an entirely DIFFERENT sort of terror and broke free from the hand, running down the hall and making his bladder slam around inside him with each step.

Alex chased after him, grabbing his arm again once he’d caught up. “Shhh…” he soothed. “It’s okay. None of it’s real, remember?”

Adam felt silly having Alex console him, when so often it was the other way around. He felt silly that he’d gotten so freaked out by what he KNEW was just an actor sticking a slimy hand prop through a hole inside the wall. He felt silliest of all that he’d started to— That he’d almost— “Alex, I really have to—“

“Shh…” Alex hushed again, smoothing a hand down his body. “Poor thing, you’re so shaky…” he said. “It’s alright. I will keep you safe.”

Camille caught up. “Adam, what gives?” she asked, and now she sounded far more concerned than she did amused. “Normally you just laugh through these things… You got a phobia of slimy stuff I don’t know about?”

Adam tensed up more at the mere THOUGHT of laughing. If he laughed, he’d explode himself into billions of pieces for sure… “S—Something like that,” he said. “And I wasn’t expecting it. I’m fine now. Don’t worry.”

They kept walking, passing a corpse hung from the rafters, some human meat dangling from hooks, and a graveyard. All of which gave Alex plenty of opportunities to cling onto Adam, and added more liquid to the ocean Adam was already holding. At one point, Alex yelped when a rubber bat swung and hit the back of his head.

Adam squeezed his hand and gave him a kiss— Even if he had to piss like CRAZY right now, he hadn’t forgotten that his REAL job was taking care of Alex. “You’re okay…”

Alex felt himself going warm. “You are too…” he said, kissing Adam back.

Another zombie rushed from the shadows to greet them. This one was a woman, with long hair dripping with red liquid. “Lovers…” she hissed out. “I was in love once too… Of course, then I butchered him!”

On cue, another zombie popped up behind Adam, shouting something loudly. Adam didn’t hear what, he’d just been so surprised by the sudden appearance of a second zombie when he was focused on the first that he gasped and stumbled, his heart hammering and the world falling away for a moment—

But, when that moment of fright passed, and the world returned… Adam became acutely aware that his crotch was soaked, his legs were warm and damp, and rather than the agonizing sensation of holding back a gallon of pee, he was experiencing a blissful drop in pressure as his bladder emptied itself.

For a second after this realization, Adam just froze. The first thing he felt wasn’t embarrassment or dismay, but just RELIEF. God, he’d had to go SO bad… His holding muscles finally unclenching and relaxing felt absolutely wonderful, his swollen bladder slowly shrinking back to its proper size almost made him MOAN.

But then there was the way the piss poured into his boxers and suit-pants, making the material heavy and sodden as it clung to him even tighter than Alex had. The smell of his pee entered his nostrils and then he remembered that, no matter how amazing it felt to be letting go, he was having an ACCIDENT.

He was having an accident in front of Alex. In front of Camille. In front of two haunted house actors that he didn’t even know… He fought to stop his flow, as if the damage weren’t ALREADY done, but his bladder wouldn’t cooperate. It had BURST, and he wasn’t going to stop peeing until he was good and empty.

And… That was going to take a while. He hoped for a second that, since his pants were dark and the room was dark, maybe no one could tell what was happening to him right now. But, even if they couldn’t SEE the urine darkening his clothes, they could DEFINITELY hear it hissing down his legs and splashing beneath his feet.

It took Alex a moment to work out what the noise was, and why Adam had suddenly just… Frozen like that, but once he figured it out he nuzzled his boyfriend even closer. Having wet himself from fear several times before, Alex knew how he must have been feeling.   Except then, Adam’s spill just kept going on and on and on, and Alex began to wonder if the scare alone hadn’t been responsible for this. Adam had obviously been holding that, and now Alex was seeing his jumpy, nervous behavior in a whole new light.

Once Camille realized what had come over Adam, she looked away from him, deciding he’d probably like some privacy. She was surprised this had happened— If anyone was going to pee themselves here, she’d been SURE it would be Alex. Adam had never even really SCREAMED at one of these things before, let alone wet his pants!

And… Jesus, was he EVER gonna finish?! The guy must have been holding in a swimming pool.

Finally, they started moving again when Alex figured Adam would want to get AWAY from the zombie actors he’d just embarrassed himself in front of. They turned one more corner, and there was a door. Alex pushed it open, and they were outside… A sign pointing towards the restrooms right there.

Adam released the moan he’d held back while they’d been inside the haunted house. But, instead of sounding relieved, it sounded utterly dismayed. He couldn’t believe it. If he’d just been able to wait ONE more freaking minute… If that last zombie hadn’t—

Fuck, and piss was STILL streaming down his legs, too…

Alex heard the hissing. “Um… Adam?”

Adam looked away. “Y—Yeah?”

“Are you… Not done?” Alex asked awkwardly.

“Alex, oh my God… I had to go SO bad…” Adam mumbled, finally feeling his last spurts trickle out. “I— Shit, I think I’m finished now.”

Alex didn’t chide him for cursing, or for taking the Lord’s name in vain. This situation probably called for that. Poor Adam, peeing himself when he was so close to the finish line…

“Adam, are you okay?” Camille asked. “What— You’ve never gotten scared like—“

“I’d been dying to piss since when we were still waiting to get in,” Adam explained. “Then when that last thing jumped out at me… I lost it. I’m sorry.”

Alex’s brow knit. “Adam, gosh… You were needing it THAT long?”

Adam nodded. “The slushys… I looked for a toilet when I threw the cups out, but I couldn’t find any around the entrance… Then when it got bad we were so close to the front of the line, I just— I thought I’d be able to hold it.”

Alex hugged him. “Poor thing…” he said, rubbing his back. Thinking back to things he’d told his younger siblings after they’d wet themselves, he added; “It’s alright, accidents happen to everybody… I bet you feel much better now though, right?”

Adam nodded. “Y—Yeah…” he squirmed. “I don’t wanna get pee on your costume…”

“It’s okay…” Alex said, not letting go. “All better now…”

Adam blushed. “I actually— When I first started… Going, it actually just felt so good that I didn’t notice everything else,” he admitted.

Alex winced. Adam must have been BEYOND desperate, in that case… Alex’s own bladder throbbed, reminding him that he was starting to get that way himself.

Which meant he’d made it through the haunted house totally dry! He’d done it!

But, somehow this victory didn’t feel as good as he’d thought it would. He tightened his hold on Adam. “I have to use the restroom, too…” he murmured.

“I’ll take you, don’t worry,” Adam said. He forgot about his soaked pants, the stain he knew must have been covering his crotch. He was embarrassed, he didn’t want MORE people to see that he’d had an accident, but Alex was the priority. Alex was always the priority.

Alex let go of Adam, and started to dance around from foot to foot, holding himself tightly. He was having an easier time FAKING a pee dance now than he had the last time he’d tried it. It helped that he ACTUALLY needed to go pretty bad, and his bladder really WAS sending him signals to squirm about.

What WASN’T easy was getting himself to pee into his clothes deliberately, and it was even HARDER to do that when he was fidgeting and doing all the things that helped him hold it IN. He kept telling himself to pee, though. Over and over, he thought ‘It’s time to go pee now,’ and he soon felt a little flare of pressure at his opening, a tiny pulse of warmth. “Oooh— Adam, I have to go SO bad! I don’t know if I can—“

Adam watched Alex jump about, surprised by how suddenly this had hit him. All the excitement must have distracted him, and now it was slamming into him all at once. “Alex, it’s okay, I’ll—“

“I can’t— I can’t—“ Alex tried his best to sound panicked and like he didn’t want this happen as his bladder unclenched and released itself. But, since the reality was that he’d WANTED to wet himself, and he was relieved he’d managed to make himself DO it, his tone started to sound less genuine. “Ohhh, I can’t hold it…” he moaned, liquid trickling warmly down his legs, which were bare beneath his robe. “Oh no…”

Adam could tell right away that this hadn’t been a real accident— If it were real, Alex would have been sobbing. But, he felt his chest going very warm. Accidents DEVASTATED Alex, and he had a feeling the other had been extremely proud of himself for making it to the end of the haunted house without having one. But, he was allowing himself to leave here soaked ANYWAY just to make Adam feel better…

Adam put a hand to Alex’s shoulder. “Aww, Alex… You didn’t have to do this.”

Alex was shaking, shivers ripping up and down his spine as pee flowed and flowed into the dirt at his feet, hissing and splashing noisily. “I DID have to, Adam… I couldn’t wait!” he insisted. “I couldn’t make it to the toilet, I had to go too much!”

Adam kissed him on the cheek. “Poor thing…”

Alex got a little tenser the longer his ‘accident’ went on. He became more aware of what he was actually doing; That he was peeing himself very forcefully in a public place, with strangers all around him— With Camille right there to see it! She certainly wasn’t gonna think he was cool now, that was for sure…

Alex pushed on his bladder muscles, hurrying to finish up. He was a tad surprised with how much he’d had in there, and figured that if the toilets here had any kind of line, this ‘accident’ would have happened for real anyway. Finally, the last was drained from him, and with another shudder, he sighed out “D—Done…” he said. “I’m sorry, I tried to wait!”

Adam looked away, blushing. “You did your best… Let me go check if there are towels in the car.”

“Okay,” Alex agreed.

Adam started to walk back towards the parking lot, doing his best to shield his wet spot from onlookers even in the darkened night.

Camille turned to Alex, “That was really sweet…” she told him.

“Huh?” Alex asked, pretending he didn’t know.

“Peeing yourself so he wouldn’t feel alone,” Camille said. “I definitely wouldn’t be willing to do that. You really ARE an angel, aren’t you?”

“Heh…” Alex reddened. “Adam says so, anyway…”

Written for the Omovember prompt "Cosplay".

***

Alex hoped that his costume looked right… Adam had promised him that it did, but Alex was nervous anyway. What if somebody noticed a minor mistake and called him out on it? That would be really embarrassing!

“It looks perfect,” Adam repeated. “I don’t think ANY of the details are wrong— And, if one of them is, nobody will notice. It isn’t like you’re going to be in the costume contest anyway, no one’s gonna look TOO closely at you.”

“Did I pick a good thing to dress up as?” Alex asked. “What if it’s too lame?”

“It’s not,” Adam assured. He made himself stop short of adding “Alex, you’re going to a place full of dorks, they’re gonna have a different definition of the word ‘lame’.”

Alex ran a hand through his ponytail. “My hair’s kinda long for it… And the wrong color. Does that matter?”

“No,” Adam said. “You look cool. I promise.”

Alex and Adam were going to a comic convention today. Alex had dressed up as Prince Caspian from the Chronicles of Narnia. Growing up, Alex hadn’t been allowed to read that many books. He was permitted to read his Bible whenever he wanted, of course. And he was often given a series of guidebooks on how to be a proper wife and mother. Alex had never been sure if he agreed with those guidebooks, they usually had things in them discussing how a wife should always agree with and obey her husband no matter what. One time, he’d asked Papa “But, what if the husband does something sinful? Should his wife still stand by him even then?” And Papa had gotten so angry… Alex hadn’t understood why, but once Papa was through, Alex had learned not to ever ask questions like that.

Aside from that, Alex was allowed to read Narnia, since Papa approved of the religious allegories present throughout the series. These were stories Alex could enjoy, because they were filled with adventure. Through the books, he could have a glimpse of things he didn’t think he’d ever get to experience for real— And not JUST because he didn’t have a portal to a magical world in his wardrobe. So many of the things Alex had wanted to do didn’t require magic at all, but he still hadn’t believed he’d be able to do any them.

Alex had recently gotten to see the film versions of Narnia for the first time and had really loved them.

So, when Adam said that sometimes people would dress up as their favorite characters at comic conventions, Alex had decided to do exactly that. He didn’t know why he was having so many second thoughts now. HE liked his costume a lot, and that was all that should have mattered.

Maybe he just felt weird right now because they hadn’t left the apartment, and Adam hadn’t worn a costume. He did look out of place standing in the front hall dressed like he was from the medieval times while Adam was wearing his usual shirt and shorts. Once he was at the convention, surrounded by other people who had dressed up, maybe he wouldn’t be as self conscious.

“Ready to go?” Adam asked him.

Alex nodded.

“Oka— Um…” Adam blushed. “Er— We should probably pee first. It’s a really long drive out there.”

Alex agreed. The costume was a little… Tricky to get apart. It would be a bad idea to get desperate to go while he had it on. He and Adam entered the restroom.

Adam unzipped quickly and easily, aiming for the bowl. He was just about to let go when he realized Alex was still struggling with the costume. He decided to hold it until Alex was ready too. But, that proved a bit difficult. Adam hadn’t needed to go that much when he’d come in here, but standing there, right in front of the toilet, with his dick aimed was sending a lot of signals to his bladder that it was time to relax.

Alex finally managed to get his buttons apart and took aim, releasing a quick stream. Adam followed suit. He no longer even thought about the unusualness of this little ‘ritual’ they had anymore. There had been no reason for them to pee together this time, neither of them had been bursting at the seams. Adam probably could have gone before Alex was ready and the sound and sight of it wouldn’t have tormented his boyfriend’s bladder at all. But, Adam just LIKED peeing next to Alex, for whatever reason it felt GOOD to do this.

Since Alex hadn’t even asked if they were going to pee side by side, had just immediately followed Adam to the toilet the instant the bathroom door was open, Adam knew Alex liked this too.

Both emptied, they headed out to the car and started the drive to the convention center. Alex felt more excited now, less worried that there was a minor error with his costume. He was looking forward to seeing what activities he’d get to enjoy at this new thing.

The drive WAS awfully long though. Alex was very grateful he’d relieved himself before getting in the car. Halfway there, he felt pressure in his bladder and couldn’t imagine how much worse off he’d be if he’d started the ride already a little full.

He DID need to go a little bit again now, but there was no fear that he wouldn’t be able to make it to their destination.

By the time they’d arrived, Alex DEFINITELY had to pee, and he was glad that he didn’t have much time left to wait. His urge had progressed to a constant, numb tingling in his middle— The warning throbs that he didn’t have much time left before he needed the bathroom REALLY urgently. He promised himself that even if he saw something that looked really interesting and that he wanted to check out, his FIRST stop was going to be a toilet. He wanted all of this out of himself as fast as possible so he could focus on having fun.

Alex ended up breaking that promise.

Once they were in front of the center and had bought their tickets by the entrance, Adam said that there was a panel he wanted to see that started soon. “Want to do that first?” He asked.

Alex nibbled on his lip. He wanted to pee first! How soon did the panel start? Did he have time to go? “Er— When does it—“

“About ten minutes,” Adam said. “So, we have a bit of time.”

Alex placed a hand over his middle, his need spiked until he felt a little bit of stinging at his opening. But, when he pulled his hand away, he felt better. Ten minutes was probably long enough for him to pee. “Okay,” he said.

“Awesome,” Adam said, taking Alex’s hand and starting to lead him to the entrance. “Make sure you’ve always got my hand in here, okay? It’s gonna be really crowded. And, if it’s too much, tell me and we’ll find a quiet spot a few minutes.”

Alex nodded, feeling warmth flood his veins, far outweighing the pee throbbing away in his system. Adam took such good care of him… But then, didn’t that mean he ought to TELL his boyfriend that he needed to go? He’d nearly burst more times than he could count just because he hadn’t said the words “Adam, I have to pee!” out loud soon enough.

Before he could ponder that further, Adam had ushered him inside the center. Adam had been right, it WAS super crowded. And noisy. A lot of the other people were dressed up as well, most of them as characters Alex couldn’t identify. He recognized some of them from things Adam had shown him, but a ton remained complete mysteries. Maybe he’d learn about some more of the books and movies that he’d missed out on today.

He was so distracted by all the costumes that he sort of just forgot that he had to pee. There were so many other things here that were more interesting than peeing. They walked by tables where people sold artwork and old comic books. Alex was fascinated by a few of them, but the REALLY old ones were all super expensive, so all he could do was look at their covers beneath their protective sleeves. He spent several minutes going through a box of action figures one man was selling.

And he didn’t once think ‘Oh, I probably should be finding a toilet now…’

The need finally hit him again when Adam said it was time to head to the panel. On the way there, they passed a restroom. ‘Wait!’ Alex’s bladder begged. But, then he saw the line sprawling out of the men’s room. Waiting in that would definitely take too long, and Alex didn’t want to make Adam miss his thing when he still felt like he could hold it.

Alex promised his bladder that he’d go RIGHT after the panel was over— First thing!

They found the room the panel was being held in and sat down together. The room was already pretty full, since the event was due to begin any moment now.

Alex hadn’t known what it was going to be about, and when it started he was happy to learn it featured the writer for a show he’d already watched lots of episodes of with Adam. Good. He’d actually understand what everyone was talking about! It would have been much harder to hold his pee if the only thing he could distract himself with was discussion of a topic that was outside his reach.

Even when he DID recognize the characters and plot-lines being talked about, Alex’s bladder was too loud to be fully ignored. He kept shifting in his chair, leaning from side to side and trying not to bounce his legs. Every time he moved, he felt the liquid inside of him slosh and roll. He was dreading having to stand back up again once this was over, but looking forward to that moment at the same time. Once this was over, he could free himself from the pressure and he’d only have to concentrate on having a good time.

Adam noticed Alex’s squirming and gave a pause. Was the crowd bugging him? This room wasn’t SUPER packed, he didn’t think. “You okay?” he whispered.

Alex made himself go still. He didn’t want Adam to worry about him, or think they had to leave before the panel had finished! “I’m fine,” he said. His bladder pulsed, reminding him of how not-fine he was. Nervously he reached a hand up and ran it through his ponytail.

Adam kept watching him, concern clear on his face. Alex sure didn’t look comforta—

Alex… Sometimes, he messed with his hair when he had to use the bathroom. Adam had seen him do that before, he recognized it as a—

He recognized it as a sign!

Finally!

Adam had always felt so bad before, never noticing Alex had to take a toilet break until he was dancing and holding himself and making it blatantly obvious that he was about to burst. Not being able to work it out sooner had always made Adam worry he wasn’t as good at taking care of him as he’d like to be.

But, he’d finally worked out one of the things Alex did when he was just BEGINNING to feel desperate! He thought back and remembered how Alex had seemed to linger as they’d passed the restroom earlier, and was positive that he was right!

“I— I can tell that you have to pee!” Adam whispered, tone far more excited than he’d intended it to be.

Alex blushed. “A— A little,” he admitted. How had Adam figured it out? He’d been making himself sit extra still! “But, it’s not bad!” He added quickly. “We can stay until the end.”

Adam nodded. He felt less worried for Alex now that he knew what was ACTUALLY bugging him. He’d just take him to the toilet as soon as this was done, and everything would be fine.

By the time the panel had ended, Alex’s earlier claim that his need was ‘not bad’ had been completely proven wrong. It WAS bad, and he’d spent the last twenty minutes with his legs knotted and his fingers drumming anxiously against the tops of his thighs. He stood from his chair, his bladder giving a huge, heavy lurch. He winced, reminding himself it wouldn’t be much longer…

“Alright,” Adam said, standing as well. “Let’s get you to the toilet before we do anything else.”

Alex nodded gratefully, taking tiny half-steps after his boyfriend. They resumed holding hands once they were out of the room and back in the large sea of people. Alex was gripping Adam’s extremely tightly. He wasn’t frightened of all the people— At least not THAT much— he just had this NEED to squeeze something every time his bladder throbbed.

Adam cringed as Alex’s hand tried to snap his own into pieces. “I’m sorry…” he said. “It’s getting bad, isn’t it? Should we have left earlier?”

“No,” Alex said. “I’m okay.”

Adam hoped that was true. He’d been so proud of himself for figuring out Alex’s problem earlier, but now he was wracked with guilt again. Had Alex downplayed his urge so that Adam wouldn’t miss the discussion? It sure seemed that way… He held onto Alex and led him through the throngs of people, trying to remember where he’d seen that restroom.

Alex was getting knocked around in the crowd, having to squeeze his way past a few people, and having his bladder bounced and crushed at an absolutely agonizing frequency. He ended up having to tuck the hand not locked with Adam’s against his crotch, knees rubbing together.

Adam was walking too fast! Alex had to take wide steps to keep up, every time his legs parted too far, his urethra stung and twitched and he felt a drop just at the very edge of seeping out. One more knock to his bladder, and a bit of warmth was soaking into his boxers. “Hahhh—“ he panted, straining his thighs together. “N—Not so fast…”

Adam slowed down to a more even pace, and Alex felt both better and worse. It was easier to take slow, careful steps, but those weren’t getting him to a toilet any quicker!

Finally, they’d found the restrooms again… And the line for the men’s looked even LONGER than earlier! Adam looked over his shoulder, his brows knotting in sympathy for Alex. “It— It’ll move fast, I’m sure.” He wasn’t sure.

They got in line at the back, and now that he wasn’t walking anymore, the change in momentum actually made the boulder of urine in his abdomen press even MORE firmly against his sphincters. He hopped between his feet, like he was trying to shake his feet awake. He noticed he was still holding himself, and let go, but right away he was leaking, so he crammed the hand back between his legs and allowed his thighs to crush it as they strained together.

Adam was still holding his other hand. He should have just— The SECOND he’d realized Alex had to pee, he should have insisted they go STRAIGHT to the toilets right then! Adam was even starting to feel the urge to go just from looking at him…

The line inched forward and Adam released a breath. “S—See? You won’t have to wait too long!”

Alex wasn’t sure if he believed that. He felt like he had very, very little time left. Cold sweat was running down his back. He couldn’t stop thinking that he was about to soak himself right where he was standing, with so many people around to witness! And then, he’d ruin his costume! First time he’d ever worn it, and he was about to drench it in his pee! That was so awful he didn’t even want to contemplate it!

Adam’s mind was in over-drive, trying to come up with a solution. Was there anywhere else Alex could go? All the other restrooms probably had lines that were just as long. It was daylight, and there were SO many people, taking him outside to pee wouldn’t work. Adam had brought a bag to carry anything they ended up buying today in, but it was empty; No container for Alex to relieve himself into— Not like he had the privacy for THAT anyway.

The line moved again. Alex had his eyes squeezed shut and hadn’t noticed, so Adam tapped him to get him to step forwards.

The guy in front of them turned around, he watched Alex’s wriggling for a moment. “Um… Does he need to cut ahead?”

Alex blushed scarlet, but Adam smiled gratefully. “Yes, that would help us out so much,” he said. “Thank you.” He helped Alex to take his spot ahead of that man. “Th—There you go,” he whispered. “One less person to wait through.”

“Adam, I really, really need to go…”

“I know…” Adam said. “Your turn will be real soon!”

They kept crawling forwards. It felt to Alex like they’d been waiting for over an hour, but it couldn’t have been more than five minutes before they were close enough to the restroom entryway that Alex could hear noises from inside of it. Hissing streams, toilets and urinals being flushed, gushing faucets… Ahhh, no, he could hear a man sighing with relief, too! He scrunched up his face, wished he had his hands free so he could cover his ears. Nothing was worse than listening to other people pee when he was fighting so hard not to burst all over himself!

A few more minutes, and they were actually inside the restroom. Only three more people ahead of them, but Alex could SEE the urinals now, could hear the pee striking them so much more clearly! Spurts were emptying into his boxers every second.

When there was just one person ahead of him, Alex started to whimper as his boxers grew more sodden. That man took his place at a urinal, and Alex doubled over when he heard another getting flushed. When he did not immediately rush to the now-open urinal, Adam tapped him. “Sweet thing, you can go now…” he whispered.

Alex looked up, saw the free place and hobbled over to it as fast as his bladder would allow. His heart kept pounding, his pulse rushing in his ears. He was so close to a complete accident, so, so close… And there were so many people here, and the urinals didn’t have dividers, and— That didn’t matter, Adam was here, too. Alex just had to— To get his costume apart and GO!

But, that was a whole lot easier said than done.

He shouldn’t have dressed up. He should have just worn his shorts. With his shorts, he just had to unzip them and he was ready to let it flow! With this, he had to take apart a whole series of buttons covering his fly, And his hands were shaking so much he couldn’t even manage to thread ONE through its opening! He stomped his feet, bouncing up and down, the sight of the urinal in front of him was such a horrific tease… He needed help—- Ahhh— How could Adam help him out with everyone here to see?!

Another urinal opened and Adam walked over to it. He may as well go now, even though he didn’t have much of an urge yet. He didn’t want to risk waiting through a line like that in the state Alex had just done it…

He was glad the urinal was beside Alex’s, they both felt safer peeing side by side when they were in public. When he made it, he realized Alex wasn’t actually peeing yet. Just, squirming there, fumbling like mad with his costume…

Adam’s hand froze from where it had been about to pull down his zipper. If he peed now, it would be a cruel and unusual bout of punishment for Alex. He needed to help out his boyfriend before anything else. “L—Let me,” he said.

Alex whimpered at the sound of another urinal being flushed. Another person had just finished doing what he NEEDED to do, and he was still stuck holding it! “P—People…” he stammered.

“I’m not gonna let you wet yourself right in front of a toilet,” Adam said, turning to his side and unfastening the first of Alex’s buttons.

Alex shook and trembled, more drips of pee escaping from him as Adam’s hand just barely brushed the swell of his bladder. His eyes darted all around. A couple of the guys still in line were staring at them, he was sure of it… He twitched more under what he was certain were scrutinizing, judgmental gazes.

A few more buttons came undone, and Alex now had the access he needed to relieve himself. Adam could see the dark patch on his boxers now, but didn’t’ mention it. “There,” he said. “Everything’s oka—“

Alex had already fished his prosthetic free and turned back to the urinal, finally unclenching his muscles and allowing his stream to gush out like it had been dying to. He released a long sigh through his nose, beginning to shake in a different way as tingles of pleasure ripped up and down his spine.

Adam finished his pee LONG before Alex did, but after he’d washed his hands he waited by the sink for him. He wasn’t going to leave Alex alone for anything. He watched the guy shuddering with relief for well over a minute before he finally flushed the urinal and came over to the sink. He washed his hands off, then grabbed Adam’s wrist again as they left the room.

“That feel better?” Adam asked once they were outside the restroom.

Alex nodded. “Yeah, but… Do you think anybody thought it was weird?”

“Hm?”

“You helping me with the costume…”

Adam shrugged. “Nah, I don’t think so. You see some of the suits these people have got on? I bet a few of them would need, like, three friends helping them get undressed enough to piss! That kinda thing happens sometimes. It’s no big deal.”

Written for the Omovember prompt "In Formal Clothes".

I've been really excited about this chapter, I hope everyone likes it 🙂

***

Adam and Alex stepped out of the car, Alex adjusting his stiff legs, and nervously patting his pocket to make sure it wasn’t empty. He was very anxious for what he had planned today, but there were still a few more hours left before he’d have to actually do anything— Which, really just meant he’d have to sit around and fret for all that time.

He and Adam were on their way to Alice’s wedding, Alice being one of Adam’s cousins. Alex was nervous about meeting Alice and her groom, but he was mostly worried about what he intended to do once he and Adam went to a restaurant AFTER the wedding.

Namely, he was going to ask Adam if they could maybe have a wedding of their own soon…

Alex wasn’t sure why this was terrifying him so much. Adam adored him, and he couldn’t imagine a scenario in which he’d actually say “No”. But, Alex hadn’t been able to afford a super fancy ring, it was just a little silver band. And, since Adam didn’t usually wear rings, Alex had sort of had to guess which size to pick by seeing which one fit HIS finger the best. He and Adam were just about the same size, so he HOPED that was right, but he couldn’t help worrying it would turn out to be too small, or not impressive enough…

To try and make the ring a little more exciting, he’d gotten it engraved with the words ‘Forever Your Sweet Thing.” Which he hoped wasn’t too corny…

“You’ll like Alice,” Adam promised, noticing the anxiety on Alex’s face. “She’s super nice.” He understood Alex got fearful around new people, but really, Adam thought HE was the one with more reason to be nervous today.

He’d been talking to Alice about her wedding, and how she knew for sure her future husband Mark was the one and that they were ready to begin a new phase of life together, and it had made him think about a lot of things.

Alex was definitely the one. Adam couldn’t imagine life without him, couldn’t sleep without him tucked protectively under his arm, watching him explore life and discover more things about himself and the world around him made Adam’s heart swell. They’d lived together for so long now, they spent almost every moment in one another’s company. It was probably time to make it official, right?

So, Adam had gotten a ring, which was now firmly nestled in the pocket of his suit. The phrase ‘And now abide faith, hope, love, these three;’ was on the outside of the band, and the words ‘but the greatest of these is love’ were engraved on the inside. This was from a Bible verse that was often preached during wedding ceremonies, and it was something that had immediately made him think of Alex when he’d read it.

He was sure Alex would love that ring, and he didn’t doubt Alex would say ‘yes’ to marrying him, but anxiety churned inside of him all the same. What if Alex didn’t think they were ready? Or, just got sad at the idea of a wedding where only some of his family would be willing to show up?

At least Adam had time to prepare something to say to Alex. He wasn’t planning on proposing until after his cousin’s wedding, once he and Alex were at dinner.

Adam’s nerves weren’t helped by the fact his cousin had chosen to have the wedding outdoors. If Alex said ‘yes’, Adam would make sure THEIR wedding was INSIDE somewhere. It was much too hot to be wearing a suit outside… He was just glad there was a water cooler nearby, and that there were plenty of cups left beside it. He poured himself a cup, and got one for Alex too. He was sure Alex was roasting just as badly as he was.

Alex took the cup gratefully and eagerly sipped at its contents. He was so nervous about tonight that his mouth was going dry! He finished his cup, and then refilled it, Adam doing the same seconds later.

Adam’s parents showed up a while later, along with Adam’s younger brother, Keith. Alex said hello to all of them, but his hands shook as he waved. Adam’s Mom and Dad had kind of always treated him like a member of their family, so they’d be happy if Alex really DID become a part of it, right? And Keith liked him well enough, too… He had no reason to worry about Adam’s family disapproving, none at all.

He worried anyway.

Mostly, he was worried about his OWN family. His Mom, Grandmother and most of his siblings would be happy for him, but he couldn’t help remembering the scary encounter he’d had with Papa at the store a few months ago. Papa would be furious about Alex marrying Adam. Papa had always told him growing up that HE would choose Alex’s spouse once he was old enough. There was a very specific ‘courtship’ process Alex was supposed to go through, involving Papa picking a suitable man from another family in their church, then monitoring their dates for a few months. Once the man decided he’d like to marry Alex, he would then have to ask Papa’s permission, and if Papa said it was okay, they would all begin planning the wedding together.

He’d told Adam about the process once, a little while after they’d first met. Adam had immediately asked “But, wait… Where’s the part where YOU decide if you wanna be with that dude forever or not?”

And Alex had just shrugged, “I don’t decide. I guess I just have to hope I like him.”

“Alex. That’s, like, super messed up,” Adam had told him. “You know that, don’t you?”

Alex hadn’t known that. Not at the time, anyway…

“I mean, what if the guy just ACTS nice around your Dad, and then when he’s not watching, he… Like, hits you, or something? Are you not allowed to say that you don’t wanna be with a person like that?”

Alex had never considered that before. He knew Papa hit Mom an awful lot, usually not in front of him, but he still HEARD it often enough to know what was happening. He’d seen Mom crying afterwards, she talked about how she felt trapped… “I— I think I’d still have to marry him if Papa said so… And, the church says we’re not allowed to divorce, so… If he hit me, I’d need to just…”

Adam noticed Alex’s eyes welling up. “Hey, hey… No, don’t cry,” he said. “I wasn’t trying to make you cry… I— I really don’t think your Dad should be allowed to pick… But, I hope whoever it is gives you lots of hugs, and makes sure you know he loves you.”

“I hope so too…”

And after that, Alex ended up not following the courtship process at all. He’d chosen Adam for himself.

Papa would be furious if they got married. If the fact Alex was marrying Adam wasn’t enough to set him off, Alex wearing a suit to his wedding would probably make the man just explode. Of course, Alex didn’t NEED to tell Papa, but did new marriages get, like, published somewhere? Like, in the news, or anywhere else Papa would see? Papa could find out without Alex saying a word!

Alex would have to ask Adam if there was a way to make sure Papa didn’t hear the news. But, he couldn’t ask THAT until after he knew Adam wanted to get married to start with!

He and Adam sat down in a couple of the chairs, waiting for Alice’s wedding to start. By that point, they’d both filled their water cups a few more times, and were still thirsty enough to take occasional sips from them while they waited.

Adam thought he should probably STOP drinking pretty soon. He was beginning to feel a slight urge to use the toilet, and he wasn’t sure where exactly he could go to take care of that. He hoped he wouldn’t have to wait until dinner…

The best course of action would be to stop sending any more water to his bladder, and stop THINKING about needing to pee until after he’d found a spot to go. But, now that he was concentrating so much on not doing those things, his throat was feeling extremely parched, and his every thought quickly started to involve using the restroom. Despite his attempts to ignore his thirst, he finished his cup once more a few minutes later, all of it now flowing through his body.

Adam glanced from side to side, they were out in a big field in the middle of a park. Parks typically had bathrooms around the pathways, but he couldn’t see any from where he was. He was sure there HAD to be a toilet somewhere close by, and was beginning to think he should just get up and ask somebody for directions, but then people were gathering around the makeshift stage and Adam knew the wedding was about to begin.

He could hold it through the ceremony, at least. He didn’t need to go THAT much. As soon as it was over, he’d ask where to go to alleviate his little problem.

Alex nervously rubbed his hands over his thighs, patting his pocket yet again to make sure the ring hadn’t rolled out of it. It was still there. Good.

Alex… Needed to go to the bathroom. Not good.

How much water had he drank? He’d filled that cup up four— No, five!— times, hadn’t he? Oh, what an awful idea! But, he always drank more when he was anxious, and it was also so warm out today, he just hadn’t been thinking!

He’d been to weddings before, both at his old church and his new one. They varied in length, and he THOUGHT he could probably contain himself until the end so long as he rushed to the toilet right away afterwards. Wait, where were the toilets? He looked back and forth, not spotting anything that looked as though it would house a restroom.

People were milling about on the stage, and Alex wondered if he had time to tell Adam he needed to go. Adam would find him a spot right away, he knew. “Adam, I—“

Before he could finish, the processional began, the groom walked down the aisle, followed by the best man, the groomsmen and the bridesmaids.

Alex was going to have to wait.

He was distracted for a little bit, Adam’s younger cousin Sam made a really cute ring bearer, and the groom’s sister was an adorable flower girl. He also liked seeing Alice being walked down the aisle with both of her parents, but it made his chest twist a little too; Only one of his parents would even consider attending HIS wedding…

The officiant started to give a few opening remarks, and talked for so long that Alex was really feeling his need again. It was growing worse by the second, his bladder steadily expanding to accommodate all of the water he’d foolishly guzzled. He rubbed his hands over his thighs some more, growing agitated. He was fighting not to tap his feet, cross his legs, or do anything that could be seen as ‘disruptive.’

Adam had been certain that his suit fit him just right this morning, but now he was having second thoughts. It was beginning to feel too small, constricting, especially around his waist. It was seriously squeezing into him there, cutting sharply into a very sensitive area of his body. His kidneys were continuing to pump more liquid into his bladder, and he seriously wished they’d take a break from that for a few minutes! He could assure them, he had more than enough pee to deal with already!

As casually as he could, he crossed his ankles together and allowed them to rub up against one another, squeezing his thighs. He tried to pay attention to everything on stage, all the things about Alice and her soon-to-be-husband, how they’d met, how happy they were. There were a few readings that followed, poems that the two found meaningful, and Adam tried to distract himself by thinking of things he’d want read at HIS wedding if Alex said ‘Yes’ tonight.

But, Adam couldn’t concentrate well enough. His bladder was way too full to allow him to think of anything that didn’t involve urinating. He was sure that reading poems about needing to go to the toilet super, super badly would make for an extremely odd wedding.

Alex had enjoyed the first few poems well enough, but now he couldn’t stop wondering how many more there were going to be. He leaned backwards a bit, his aching bladder sloshing with the tiny motion. He could no longer stop himself from fidgeting, and his legs were now ever so slightly pressed together, rubbing each other up and down to ease away a little bit of the pressure. It was barely even helping. He needed to move around MORE.

For a while, Alex wasn’t able to pay attention to the poems at all, but then they were reading one about two streams joining together, full of way too much watery imagery, and he couldn’t make himself STOP listening! Every last word was like a mallet to his bladder, and he shook in his seat, unable to help himself from jiggling. When someone in the row ahead of him turned around, he forced himself to go mostly still again, grinding hard against his chair. His bladder was painful inside him now, a furious orb of tension that refused to ease.

Next, Alice and Mark lit up a candle together. Adam hoped that, with the poems out of the way, the ceremony would be ending soon. It didn’t feel like his bladder could take much more of this. He kept gazing out into the field, imagining how good it would feel to water the grass for a couple minutes. He was not looking forward to having to stand back up again after being seated for so long. He knew it would make his need so much worse…

He crossed one leg over the other, leaning forwards and chewing on his lip. Alice and Mark were exchanging their vows now, and Adam was gritting his teeth to avoid releasing a groan. His bladder just wouldn’t settle down, the throbs were constant, getting harsher and harsher. His urethra was stinging with the need to just let it all come flowing out…

Following his thoughts, a trickle released itself into his boxers, and his hand tucked itself between his legs, before he began to rock against his arm. This suit was expensive! He couldn’t let himself get it even a little damp! He pressed his other hand against his groin and hoped that relief would be coming soon.

Alex turned, saw Adam’s obvious distress, and actually felt somewhat better knowing his boyfriend was suffering from the same thing he was. It was awful, but he was grateful he didn’t have to be alone in this. Seeing as Adam was holding himself without anyone noticing, Alex did the same thing, the tiniest modicum of relief hitting him the second he’d gotten a grip on things. Having a nice, physical barricade between his bladder and the outside world was helping so much.

The person on his other side was looking at him now though, and Alex shamefully let go, embarrassed by his blatant display of desperation. The man turned back away from him, and Alex even thought about asking him if there was a bathroom close by he could maybe run to, but he knew better. No way could he make a run for it without everyone turning to stare, he’d interrupt the entire ceremony!

He just… Had to wait.

As Alice and Mark continued with their vows, Alex tried to come up with something to say at his and Adam’s wedding (If it happened… Which, considering he was probably going to wet his pants, he wasn’t so confident if Adam would say ‘yes’ anymore or not.)

Alex imagined himself at his wedding, standing beside Adam, telling him just how much he loved him. ’Adam, you changed my life. Without you, I wouldn’t even be me. And, now I wanna be me WITH you, forever. I love—‘ He pictured himself suddenly breaking off mid-sentence, doubling over, gripping his crotch for dear life and exclaiming ‘—Ah, I need a break! I can’t hold it!’

Alex cringed. That would be the worst wedding in history…

Adam no longer cared if he was drawing attention to himself anymore. He just had to go, and he was gonna do whatever it took to KEEP himself from going in his pants. He crossed and uncrossed his legs, fidgeting wildly, rocking back and forth in his chair, squeezing himself tighter and tighter. None of it was very helpful, because a trickle of urine beaded out of him anyway, and he whimpered softly. His bladder begged for release, and he refused to give in.

Alice and Mark each placed a ring on one another’s fingers and Alex exhaled a slow, shaky breath. They were nearing the end now. Reminded, he touched his pocket again, satisfied when he felt the lump of the ring there. ‘Oooh, hurry…’ he thought, hoping the sounds of his feet tapping weren’t too loud. ‘I need the bathroom now! I’m gonna have an accident if you don’t hurry!’ Just thinking about having an accident was making it a self-fulfilling prophecy, causing a few jets of pee to squirt into his boxers. He doubled over, squeezing himself again, it didn’t matter if that man looked at him again, he just needed to hold it! He didn’t want to pee in the fancy, expensive suit Adam had picked for him!

He looked up in time to see Alice and Mark kiss, and his eyes welled up. It was almost over. So close. He’d be peeing soon! His bladder got a little over-excited, it cramped and tried its best to force him to start peeing right NOW.

The bride and groom turned back to all their guests and walked back up the aisle together, followed by their wedding party and a lot of applauding. Adam tried to clap too, but his hands were both already occupied with something his body deemed a LOT more important.

Alex managed to clap a little, but he couldn’t handle it for very long before he needed to shove his hands back against his crotch. As everything quieted down, Alex reached a hand to grip Adam’s arm.

Adam was startled, and a spurt of pee dribbled from him. “Hm, wha—“ He turned. “O—Oh, you’re about ready to burst too, huh?” He whispered.

“Adam, I need the bathroom now…” Alex mumbled.

“I—I know,” Adam said. “So do I. L—Let’s get up, and say goodbye to everyone, and ask where th—the bathroom is, okay?” Adam gently got to his feet, just as he’d suspected, his bladder did NOT enjoy the sudden change in position. It surged downwards, and he folded himself in half as his opening trembled against the tide.

Alex got up after him, jiggling up and down with frantic energy. He hoped the toilets were close. He really didn’t have much time left! After a few seconds, he was able to pry his hands away from his crotch and check his pocket again.

The ring was still there.

Adam shuffled out of their aisle, and Alex stayed right beside him. Adam took slow, careful steps, determined not to soak his fancy outfit. ‘Imagine trying to propose to Alex immediately after pissing yourself…’ he thought bitterly. He sucked in a sharp breath— He’d been squirming around so much, what if—

He forced a hand away from his groin and felt for the ring in his pocket. He felt a little TOO relieved once he’d confirmed its presence, a slosh of pee splashing into his boxers. “Ahhh—“ he shoved the hand back against himself.

Within minutes, they were beside Adam’s Mom and brother again. Keith giggled at the sight of them. “Adam looks like he’s gonna wet himself!” He announced way, WAY too loudly.

“Keith…” Adam’s Mom sighed, then looked at Adam and Alex. “Oh, you BOTH need to go, huh?”

Adam nodded. “We’ve been holding it through the whole thing,” he said. “Where’s the bathroom?”

“Just a little bit down that trail,” his Mom pointed. “Your father went that way a few minutes ago.”

“Th—Thank you,” Adam said. “C—Come on, Alex…”

They hurried down the trail as fast as their bodies would allow. Alex lost quite a few errant dribbles as they walked. His bladder just couldn’t handle being bounced around so much! He was probably gonna cry tears of relief when he finally saw the toilets.

Alex was half right. He DID feel like crying when he spotted the restroom, but NOT out of relief. He felt like crying because it looked like every man that had attended the wedding was lined up to use it, and there was no way he’d make it through all of them dry.

“Ah, shit…” Adam muttered. He too didn’t think he could last through that whole line.

But, this was a park! Trees and bushes everywhere! Plenty of other places to go! He gripped Alex by the arm and tugged him into the brush. He’d expected Alex to protest, but his boyfriend only whimpered a little at being jerked around too much.

“H—Here?” Alex asked, sounding as though he was pleading for permission even though this had been Adam’s idea to start with.

“Here,” Adam confirmed.

They both gripped their zippers and were just about to yank them down when someone came up behind them. Some guy Adam didn’t know, probably a relative of Mark’s. “You know there’s a toilet right there, don’t you?” He asked.

Adam released his zipper, hopping from foot to foot. “The line is too—“

“W—We’re sorry…” Alex shamefully stopped trying to get his clothes adjusted. “We won’t go here, promise! Please don’t tell anybody!”

Adam’s heart sank. Great. Now Alex was convinced he’d been about to do something really, really bad. No way would he agree to water the bush once this guy walked away. And Adam wouldn’t do it either if Alex was gonna be still stuck holding it.

Once the stranger had left them alone, Adam choked out “The restaurant is, like, a five minute drive. Can you make it until then?”

Alex nodded. He HAD to!

Adam hoped HE could do the same.

They fumbled and dragged themselves back to the car. They were both leaking, dripping little drops, but were managing to hold back the typhoons raging inside of them. Adam flicked the car on and anxiously pulled out. He was IMMENSELY grateful that his car was electric, he didn’t think he’d be able to handle the slight rumbling jostle of a gas-powered engine right now.

The ride was smooth, but needing to use his foot to work the pedal meant that he couldn’t cross his legs anymore. And, at least one hand needed to stay on the steering wheel, so he wasn’t getting a good grip on himself anymore, either. He envied Alex for not needing to drive, he could squirm, writhe and clutch himself for all he was worth.

All Adam could do was tense his thighs up and squeeze with one hand as hard as he could.

Alex curled over on himself when they went over a speed bump. “H—How much longer, Adam?” he mewled.

“Almost there,” Adam said. “Super close. You can make it.”

A few more turns, and they were parked in front of the restaurant. They both scrambled out and hurried to the door. Adam knew they must not have looked that great, two guys in rumpled suits, clearly fighting not to soak them in piss. If there wasn’t a toilet in this place they could use right away, he felt like he was gonna end up breaking something.

He shoved the door open and they stepped inside. The hostess greeted them, staring at their distressed posture and the hands wedged between their trembling thighs. “Er… Do you have a reserva—“

“W—We do,” Adam said. “But, uh, bathroom first, please?”

“Of course,” she told them.

Alex blushed hard, even though HE hadn’t been the one to interrupt and plead for the toilet. He still LOOKED as desperate as Adam did.

The hostess led them down a hallway and to a set of doors. “Th—Thank you,” Alex managed as Adam simply flung the door open.

Alex scurried in after him, and he nearly just started peeing when he saw the urinals. His bladder didn’t have many seconds left to spare. He hurried to the closest one, unzipping the entire way there. He’d gotten his prosthetic out, and was already positively gushing a few steps from the urinal. A little bit hit the floor, and he felt absolutely HORRIBLE, but then all that remained was the satisfying hiss of relief as his stream flowed into the porcelain.

Adam hobbled up beside him and let go of his own bladder. He couldn’t help it, he was instantly moaning as soon as the first few drops had splashed out. His poor bladder had been near bursting a second ago, and now it was finally ALL pouring out. “Ahhhhhh….”

Alex panted and gasped, shivering from head to toe and going light-headed. His unrelenting torrent slowing for a few seconds when he needed to catch his breath, and then resuming at full force. It took over a minute before its power was reduced to the level of a standard “I really gotta go!” pee break, instead of the ‘I’m gonna wet my pants!’ sort of stream he’d been releasing at first, and then it took nearly ANOTHER full minute after that before he’d stopped entirely. He was trembling as he tucked his dick back into his pants and zipped them. “Ohhh, thank goodness…” he murmured.

Adam finished a few seconds later, stumbling backwards and so out of it from the relief that he didn’t remember to zip his pants closed again. Dizzy, he turned to Alex. “I… I can’t believe I made that…” he said.

“Me neither,” Alex admitted, heading to the sinks. He cranked one on, and didn’t think it managed to match the volume both of their streams combined had reached. “That was… I— I got some on the— I started going before I was at the urinal…”

“I know…” Adam said, washing his own hands off. “I’m just glad all of that’s not IN you anymore, though. If you were feeling it like I was, it must have hurt…”

“It did,” Alex agreed. “I’m actually kinda nervous to leave the bathroom in case it turns out there’s more in there…”

“Heh, I think you got it all,” Adam said. “But, let’s make sure we go AGAIN before driving home.”

Alex nodded. He felt so relaxed now after such a relieving pee that he suddenly WASN’T so nervous about proposing to Adam. He felt like he could do it right now!

Without a second thought, Alex said; “Adam, there’s something I wanted to ask you today…”

Adam leaned against the sinks, so content. It was amazing how much better a good, long piss could make him feel. He wasn’t sure why he’d been stressed out about the proposal all day. Of course Alex would say yes… “What is it?”

“Um…” Alex touched his pocket, then started to reach in. “I… I really, really love you,” he began. “You’re my most favorite person in the world, and I’m so happy I get to spend every day with you, and… Uh… I want to— To keep doing that forever, and…” He pulled out the ring. “Um… Would you please… Be my husband now, maybe?”

To Alex’s surprise, Adam didn’t say yes OR no, he just laughed. “Pfft— Hahahaha!”

Alex shrank away. “I—If you don’t think we’re ready—“

“Ah— Sweet thing—It’s not that— You just— You proposed to me in a public restroom!” Adam snorted.

Alex blinked. He… HAD just done that, hadn’t he? “I—“

“A—And—“ Adam kept laughing, and he pulled the ring from his own pocket. “I was gonna— Tonight, I was gonna—“

Alex stared at the ring, and then he started laughing, too. “You— We were BOTH—“ Unable to hold it back, he doubled over and laughed so much tears came to his eyes. Once he’d gotten ahold of himself, he took the ring from Adam’s hand. “S—So, I guess that’s a ‘yes’?”

Adam wrapped his arms around Alex, “Yes!” he said, before giving him a kiss. “Nothing would make me happier!”

They pulled apart, and Alex slipped the ring onto his finger, then gave Adam the other one. “I h—hope it fits you okay. And I h—had something written on it, let me know if it’s too…”

Adam looked at the ring. “‘Forever your sweet thing…’” he read. “Awww… There’s stuff written on yours, too!”

Alex took it off and looked at it more closely. “1 Corinthians 13?”

“Yeah, it made me think of you,” Adam said. “You like it?”

“Of course I like it,” Alex said, his eyes welling up. “This is… I love it. I love you.”

Adam put his own ring on, and Alex was happy to see that it fit. “Let’s go have dinner now, sweet thing.”

Alex nodded and they were about to walk out the door when he suddenly stopped. “Er… Adam, your fly is still down…”

Adam glanced at his pants and blushed furiously. “Why didn’t you say that BEFORE I proposed to you?”

“I just noticed!” Alex said.

“Aw, it’s okay,” Adam said, giving him another kiss as he fixed his zipper. “I love you so much…”

Written for the 12 Days of Omo prompt "Wetting the bed on Christmas Eve".

***

It was Christmas Eve, and Adam had gotten a special surprise for Alex. “You can have one of your presents early,” he told him. “I know how excited you get on Christmas, and that you have trouble sleeping…” He produced a box from behind his back. “So, I thought you’d like this tonight.”

Alex looked over the box, which contained a peppermint tea mix that claimed it worked as a good natural sleep aid. Alex agreed that he could use the help tonight— He was so looking forward to giving his younger siblings their presents tomorrow that it probably WOULD be tricky for him to get to bed!

Adam mixed the tea up for him, and Alex drank it. The minty flavor tingled on his tongue and all the way down his throat. It was so warm, too. Soothing, and heating up his body. He finished one cup, and asked for another.

Adam obliged, and Alex polished this one off too, already feeling more tired than he had before. He yawned. “Mmmf, thank you Adam,” he said. “I think it’s working…” His eyelids drooped.

“Heh, okay,” Adam said. “Let’s get ready for bed, then.”

They showered and changed into their pajamas, Alex nearly nodding off the entire time. The shower water was so warm, like a blanket. Adam kept having to help him loll his head back up. “Aww, maybe I should have given you the tea after this, I didn’t think it would work so well on you.”

As Alex blearily brushed his teeth, Adam relieved his bladder into the toilet. Alex finished with his teeth and started to stumble out of the room, but Adam stopped him and told him to go pee first. “R—Right…” Alex mumbled, unbuttoning his pajamas and tiredly guiding his stream into the toilet. He shivered, his bladder shrinking and making him realize he really HAD needed to go. It was a really good thing Adam had reminded him.

Finally, Alex was in bed, beneath the nice, warm covers and Adam had joined him a minute later, wrapping his arms around him and kissing his forehead. “Goodnight, sweet thing…” he whispered. Alex snuggled against him, thinking about tomorrow.

They were going to tell Alex’s Mom that they were engaged tomorrow. He had a feeling she’d be very happy to hear that. And, soon, when they cuddled in bed like this, they’d be doing it as a married couple. He wondered if it would feel different then, if all the fuzzy, soft warmth in his chest would be even better… “I love you…” he said softly before finally succumbing to his drowsiness.

***

Alex was at the shopping mall, trying to remember what he was supposed to buy. But, he couldn’t remember, because he couldn’t think. He couldn’t even breathe! All he could do was focus every last scrap of his energy upon a tight, boiling ball of tension flaring angrily just beneath the taut skin of his abdomen.

If he could just please, please, please get to a bathroom soon…

Getting ANYWHERE soon wasn’t going to be easy. Alex’s shorts felt like a binder over his bladder, and every step seemed to jostle him with a purposefully cruel amount of motion and brought a hard, stinging pressure between his legs.

It didn’t help that Alex had no idea where the bathroom even WAS. If he could only find a toilet— Or maybe just a map telling him where the toilets were, he’d be okay! As it was, the agony in his core was only building and building with no end in sight!

Ooooh, where was Adam? Adam HAD come with him, right? Alex needed to relieve himself so badly that he couldn’t remember ANYTHING about the last hour or so of his life.

He spotted Adam a little ways ahead of him, looking into the window of one of the stores. Alex took off towards him, the harsh lurching of his feet causing his bladder’s contents to slosh blisteringly strong against his opening. He made it to Adam’s side and wrapped a hand around his partner’s arm, gasping out “Adam, Adam— I gotta— I need the bathroom now!”

“O—Oh,” Adam said, turning to run a soothing hand down his back. “Poor thing… You should have said something earlier!”

Had Alex tried to speak up before now…? He couldn’t remember THAT either, but apparently he must have stayed silent about his need until right this very second when he felt moments away from creating a huge puddle on the floor. “I’m sorry,” Alex said, hoping from foot to foot, his shoes clicking loudly against the ground.

“Aw, it’s okay,” Adam said. “I’ll find you a bathroom really fast, I promise.”

Adam led him off, and Alex bit back an anguished cry when he looked down and spotted the considerable bulge of his bladder. It was protruding out in a very noticeable ball on his small frame. He didn’t just FEEL like he was going to explode, he LOOKED like he’d explode, too!

Alex was taking such slow, careful steps, knowing all too well how devastating the wrong move could be for his body. He gripped himself, letting out tiny mewls of discomfort. His bladder sloshed, pee struggling against his trembling exit. His sphincters were assailed by a horrendous pain, heaviness bearing down against his aching urethra. “Ahhhnnnn—!” He grunted.

“Alex?” Adam asked. “I think we’re close, just hang on…”

“I’m gonna burst…” Alex said tearfully. “I have to go so bad!”

“Shhh…” Adam said, taking hold of the hand Alex didn’t have worked against his crotch. “Just a little further… Let’s go… Right here…”

Alex looked up and saw Adam shoving open the door to a restroom. Finally, finally…

Peeing was all he could think of as he hobbled past the threshold, thoughts of the urinal that he was about to see making his jaw tighten and his stomach flutter. He couldn’t stand this much longer…

He stumbled further into the room, glancing back and forth until he spotted the long row of urinals… Which had been installed about six feet above the floor for some reason. Alex couldn’t possibly reach high enough to pee into any of them. He didn’t think he’d ever seen ANYBODY that would be able to release their stream so high up!

It was such a weird way to set up a restroom, and Alex had to assume whoever had done it had just thought it would be funny. Alex didn’t think it was funny, but at least he could see two stalls on the other side of the room. He’d be able to use those! He rushed towards them and opened one of them eagerly.

Then his heart sank and almost crashed into his full bladder as he saw what was inside. Instead of a toilet, there was a very expensive looking, velvet reclining chair. He couldn’t be meant to pee on that, right? The chair didn’t appear stained, and it didn’t smell bad, so it seemed nobody else had ever peed onto it.

Ohhhh, but Alex had to go somewhere!

He’d… He’d go on the chair! If they didn’t want him urinating on it, then they shouldn’t have put it in a toilet stall! “Nnnnh!” He cringed, his throat insultingly dry in spite of all the liquid fighting to break out of his body. His hands flew to his zipper and yanked it down. ‘I need to— I can’t hold it— I need it now!’ His brain screamed, lost inside of his desperate haze. He pulled his prosthetic out and took a deep, deep breath as he shut his eyes. If he didn’t see the chair, it would feel less weird!

He felt his pee right at the edge of his sphincter, and was already starting to shudder in anticipation of the mind breaking relief he was sure to feel any second now.

But, then he heard Adam, “O—Oh, Alex! Don’t go!”

Every muscle Alex had cramped and his liquid retreated into the agonizing walls of his bladder once again. “But, Adam, I NEED t—“

“This isn’t an actual bathroom,” Adam said. “They’re shooting a movie here, it’s one of the sets.”

Alex zipped up, deciding that explained the oddness of this restroom. He pushed his way out of the stall. “Find me somewhere I can go, please?” He begged.

“Of course,” Adam assured, leading Alex back out of the ‘restroom’ and into the main mall again. The mall looked different somehow now. It was a lot more empty, the benches were gone and some of the stores Alex had been certain were open before were now gutted and closed, and they seemed to be more spread out than before, too. There was a vast expanse of vacant floor that spread out in all directions, and Alex couldn’t see far enough to spot a bathroom.

‘Didn’t Adam say empty space freaks him out?’ Alex recalled.

Sure enough, Adam turned to Alex with an odd look on his face. “Jeez, this place is kinda creepy…” he said. “We should leave.”

“B—Bathroom first?” Alex asked, eyes watering. “I’m sorry, I need to go super bad…”

“R—Right,” Adam said. “Don’t worry… Maybe there’s a bathroom upstairs.” Adam headed for the elevator, and Alex tried his absolute best to trail after him The spasms that moved through his absolutely FULL bladder were so intense that he was fighting hard not to cry.

The elevator may as well have been three cities away with how much strength it took Alex to walk to it. Inside Alex leaned against the wall and crossed his legs, his thighs squeezing and his hands clutching in between them. Adam hit the button for the next floor and Alex begged for the elevator to move fast— And for there to be a usable bathroom right in front of those doors the second they opened. His bladder was a painful, swollen balloon inside of him and there just wasn’t room in his body for it! “Ooooohhhh,” he moaned. “Nnnnh…. Adam— I can’t…” his face was all squished up, mouth dropping open as he panted frantically, almost hyperventilating.

“It’s okay…” Adam came to his side and patted his back, all along his tense spine. “Just a few more minutes…”

“O—Okay,” Alex whimpered, feeling a hot trickle roll down his inner thigh. “Ah—!” He gasped. There was nothing in his mind save for the immense, overpowering need to pee and ideas of what he could do to make that happen. The world seemed to all go foggy as he imagined simply giving up entirely, letting everything rush down his legs as he moaned and trembled with relief.

He shook his head, he couldn’t, he couldn’t— Another spurt leaked out of him. Then another, and another, and another. “Hah— Ahhhh—! It’s coming out!” He exclaimed miserably.

“I—It’s okay, I’ve got you…” Adam said, and then Alex felt his shorts being moved down his thighs, felt himself being lowered, felt something cool beneath his thighs. “Safe now,” Adam told him.

Alex’s eyes cracked open and he was staring up at Adam, he recognized the blue tiled walls of a restroom, and the locked stall behind Adam, he looked down and saw he was sitting on a toilet. He could barely believe his eyes, when had THAT happened? Was he hallucinating? “I—“

“You can pee now, Alex,” Adam said. “I carried you here, just let go, alright?”

Alex was so exhausted by that point that he simply moaned and told his body to release all of its liquid. He felt the first desperate, eager squirt of pee gush out of him, hissing into the bowl. For some reason, he was having trouble going any more than that. His eyes watered, tears rolling down his cheeks. He just wanted to go… Why couldn’t he go? He had to! NOW!

“Go ahead,” Adam repeated. “D—Do you wanna stand instead? I just sat you down since you couldn’t walk, I can help you back up?”

“It won’t come out,” Alex said, voice straining with pain. “It won’t let me go…”

“Just— Just relax, sweet thing,” Adam encouraged. “I think you waited too long… It’s okay!”

One more eruption of pee squirted out, and Alex felt oddly warm as it splashed into the bowl. This was followed by a few more errant drops, not at all the explosion Alex so badly wanted to feel… Why couldn’t he just GO!? Something inside of him was just refusing to let him unclench! “Adam, help? It hurts so bad!”

Adam came closer to him, put a hand to his shoulder and rubbed gently. “It will be alright, just let it happen…”

A wet trickle emerged and pattered gently into the bowl, and then there was a feeling of something in his center almost ‘popping’, and with that he was at last letting it all loose. A solid, thick stream of pure relief surged forth loudly, an absolute waterfall cascading and spattering against the water within the toilet. “Ahhhhhhhhh….” Alex moaned, eyes fluttering. He was in paradise now, the sensations of release were nothing short of exquisite. He shivered with raw satisfaction, the jet of pee surging, his bladder shrinking, his mouth hanging open with pure delight.

Adam began to hug him, rubbing up and down his back. “There you go… Good boy… Good Alex… Just let it go, all better… Poor thing!” Alex snuggled into him. Adam was so, so warm…

***

Adam’s eyes cracked open. He felt so, so warm, and a little… Damp? Confused and groggy, he sat up and looked around. His butt felt really soggy for some reason, and he could hear a hissing noise. For a second, he was worried he was in the process of wetting himself, but then he remembered that if THAT were the case, the wet feeling would be on his crotch and he still felt dry there—

He turned, seeing a dark stain growing across Alex’s lap and spreading out onto the sheets beneath him. Alex was still fast asleep, a wide, relaxed smile on his face.

Oh no…

Why hadn’t Adam woken up a few minutes earlier? He could have noticed Alex’s emergency and carried him to the toilet like he’d done once before! He was too late this time, and Alex was going to be absolutely DEVASTATED when he woke up and realized what he’d done!

What an awful way to start Christmas, wetting the bed and probably breaking down into tears over it…

There had to have been something Adam could do, right? The hissing noise had stopped, Alex had finished going… God, the sheets were soaked, Alex must have needed that really bad…

Adam ALSO needed it really bad— He HAD woken up for a reason, after all. His bladder was stretched out and hard in his stomach. He’d been in the midst of a pretty awful pee-dream where he’d been at the end of a long line of bursting men waiting for a single toilet, the line never moving and situated right beside the loudest fountain Adam had ever heard.

Maybe if Adam peed the bed as well, Alex wouldn’t be able to tell that HE’D done it? Yeah, they slept in one another’s embrace, if one of them peed the bed, the other would be wet too— As evidenced by the state of Adam’s back. Adam could just force himself to pee now, then when morning came he’d pretend that he’d had an accident— And had been the ONLY one to have one!

Adam laid back down and tried to relax his holding muscles. As bad as he needed to relieve himself, he’d thought this would be super easy to do! But, it wasn’t. He’d never deliberately gone in his pants before, and it was hard to make himself do it. Years of conditioning had trained him not to go if his clothes were in the way of his stream. He tried to remember his dream, how desperate he’d been during it, how awful the sound of the fountain had been, how he’d begged everyone in front of him to please let him go first and they’d all told him “Hold it, I’ve been waiting for ages, too!”

He thought about waterfalls and rivers, and about drinking huge glasses of water. He thought about toilets and urinals, he thought about unzipping himself in front of one and releasing something he’d been holding for long enough that it was beginning to turn his stomach.

Finally, he felt a sharp twinge at his opening, and he squeezed hard on his muscles to allow that to turn into a dribble, and then a stream. Pee gushed out and into his pajamas, rapidly warming them with wet heat. The fabric felt heavy and sticky, clinging to his thighs as more liquid filled it.

He blushed hard, he couldn’t believe he was actually doing this! He was peeing himself. And on purpose, too! It… It felt good, there was an immense lessening of the tension inside his body, and it was so NICE to allow his bladder to finally deflate. He pushed to make it come faster as he shut his eyes and pretended he was doing this into a toilet instead.

Alex started to stir, his eyes opening a moment later. He heard a very weird noise, and his crotch felt sticky and cold. ‘What’s—‘ He remembered what he’d been dreaming about, and how he’d finally managed to relieve his bladder… No, no, no— His crotch was saturated, he’d—

Tears sprang to his eyes, he’d peed the bed, and was STILL going, he tightened up his muscles, but realized he didn’t feel his bladder loosening up, he didn’t feel like he was peeing, so the hissing wasn’t coming from him— He looked over at Adam, seeing the wet spot building on his pants. Oh, no!

Alex shoved him, “Adam, Adam, wake up!” He whispered.

Adam opened his eyes, seeing Alex looking absolutely panic-stricken. He yawned, and tried to act like he was only just now waking up. “Hm…?” He let his eyes go wide. “O—Oh, no!” He put a hand between his legs, like he was trying to staunch the flow even though he could feel he was nearly finished.

“I—It’s okay!” Alex cried out. “I— I think I did that tonight, too.”

Adam’s heart sank. Alex HAD noticed his own accident, he hadn’t saved him… Adam felt the last of his pee spurt out and fought back the urge to sigh. Alex at least didn’t seem too upset for some reason, perhaps not being alone had helped? “G—Guess we both didn’t wake up in time…”

Alex shook his head and sniffled. “The tea made me sleep too much, and I think it went through me too fast… I’m sorry.”

“Hey, it’s alright,” Adam said. “I did it, too. I was… I was having the worst piss-dream ever, I swear.”

Alex managed a smile. “Couldn’t have been as bad as mine,” he said.

Adam kissed his cheek. “We can clean this up,” he assured. “It’s no big deal… I mean, we both peed before bed, that’s all we could have done about it.”

Alex nuzzled against him. “I’m still sorry… It’s Christmas, and now we have to wash the sheets…”

“That’s fine,” Adam said, pulling Alex closer. “I don’t mind. I… I feel a lot better than I did in my dream,” he added, trying to find more ways to cheer Alex up. “Don’t you?”

“…Y—Yeah,” Alex admitted after a second. “I… needed the bathroom so much that it hurt. It… It feels better now.”

“Good,” Adam said, giving him one more kiss. “Let’s get this sorted out and have a nice day now, alright?”

“Alright.”

Written for the 12 Days of Omo prompt "Christmas at a relative's house".

***

Cleaning up the damp sheets and pajama bottoms didn’t take very long. They took them down to their building’s laundry room and they were dry and smelling fresh soon enough. A cloud seemed to hang over them both, however. Alex couldn’t believe he’d had an accident like that, especially not today!

Not only was it Christmas, it was also the day he’d been planning to tell his Mom that he was getting married! Marriage was one of the biggest signifiers that a person had become an adult, but Alex couldn’t be a real adult if he was still peeing in bed, could he?

Adam was anxious about their morning’s activities, too. In spite of everything he’d done to assure Alex that his accident hadn’t been a big deal, he knew his fiancé was sure to be in a very fragile state right now. He was glad Alex hadn’t broken down and cried this time, but he kept acting like he was right on the edge of it.

Going to see his siblings would probably get him back in some better spirits, though. Adam and Alex loaded all of the gifts into the backseat of their car, and when Adam slid into the driver’s seat, he felt a pressure that told him he’d forgotten to do something important.

And Alex had forgotten as well.

Adam knew that simply reminding Alex to go pee now would be an awful idea. Alex would feel like he was being put on the spot, and that Adam was so anxious about his bladder because he no longer believed Alex could properly control it. So, instead he found a different way to ensure Alex paid attention to his body. “Oh, almost forgot; I gotta pee before we leave,” he said. “Could you keep me company?”

Alex nodded, biting his lip. He hadn’t actually relieved himself at all today. The last time he’d peed had been when he’d accidentally let loose into the sheets while fast asleep. He definitely had to go, but he’d been trying to ignore it. After he’d wet himself, each subsequent trip to the toilet made his face burn. When he was younger and peed his clothes because he wasn’t able to wait through the line for the bathroom, Papa would always be so angry… Then, for at least the next couple days, any time he saw Alex heading to the toilet, he’d comment about it. “Oh, looks like someone ISN’T too lazy to use the bathroom this time, huh?”

The attention, the extra reminders of the fact he’d soaked himself (as if he could ever forget), filled Alex with humiliation. And then he’d put off each pee until he was wriggling and it had become an emergency, just to avoid the shame.

Adam didn’t taunt him like that when these things happened to him, but just having Adam SEE him go to the toilet after he’d wet himself was enough to make him feel embarrassed. He couldn’t shake the idea that Adam was watching him go into the restroom, and thinking about it. He had no doubt that Adam’s thoughts weren’t at all malicious, that they were probably more along the lines of ‘Okay, good. He’s gonna make it this time.’ But, that was embarrassing, too!

To his dismay, those feelings were just as strong today even though Adam had ALSO had an accident in the night.

They re-entered their apartment and Adam went to the restroom. Alex fidgeted in the doorway for a second before joining him. He unzipped and aimed, letting go of his bladder for the first time all day with a shivery sigh.

Adam relaxed a moment after Alex had, yet by the time he’d finished up, Alex was still pouring away. ‘Wow, he DID need to go…’ Adam thought. ‘Wait, has he gone today at ALL?’ He tried to recall, but couldn’t think of a single moment where Alex had excused himself for the restroom until now. ‘I guess he’s been excited, so he forgot?’ That didn’t sound right, though. Surely Alex must have been thinking a lot about urinating today, considering what had happened…

Well, that didn’t really matter. It was a good thing Adam had gotten him to empty out before they got on the road, he was certain there was going to be a lot of traffic and it would be just awful if Alex suddenly realized he was having an emergency when they were trapped with nowhere to pull over.

Alex zipped his pants and washed his hands, hoping he wasn’t blushing too much. “R—Ready now?” He asked.

Adam nodded.

A half hour later, caught in bumper to bumper traffic, Alex was noticing the first pangs from his bladder once more. This drive was always little long, but today it looked as though it would take ages to get there. Alex couldn’t even guess at when they might actually arrive at their destination.

He didn’t want to have to pee!

He’d just gone before they’d left!

But, it sure felt like he was needing it again…

The memory of standing in front of the toilet, just a mere thirty minutes ago, was making him anxiously tap his fingers against his thighs as his bladder twitched. ‘There’s no way you need to pee again,’ he told himself. ‘It hasn’t been long enough! You have a big bladder, remember?’

He did remember. He remembered nearly overflowing a one liter bottle and ACTUALLY overflowing a training potty. His cheeks burned, and he tried not to think about peeing anymore. He couldn’t stop, though. Every thought eventually came back to how awful the wet sheets had felt as they’d clung to him that morning, how clammy his boxers had been, how he’d peed his pants like a child and NOT like someone that was going to get married soon!

The car inched forward through the traffic, bit by bit. Minutes kept ticking by. Alex was adjusting his position frequently, uncomfortable in his seat.

“Adam?” He asked finally. “Is it gonna be like this the whole way there?”

“I’m afraid so,” Adam said. Alex’s tone made his heart clench, it wasn’t like him to sound so gloomy and anxious on Christmas. He reached over and squeezed Alex’s hand. “Sorry about the traffic, sweet thing,” he said. Really, he was apologizing again for what Alex had woken up to. “Once we see the little ones, I bet you’ll cheer right up.”

Alex nodded. “I—I’m okay,” he insisted, deep down wondering if any of his younger siblings had ALSO wet their sheets last night. If they’d all stayed dry when HE hadn’t managed it… He tensed his thighs up when a little jolting pang of need bloomed inside his bladder. The tension in his middle was growing tighter and tighter, and he KNEW that if he just stopped paying attention to it, it wouldn’t feel so strong anymore. He just couldn’t stop focusing on how every drop of liquid inside his filling bladder felt.

By the time they’d reached their destination, Alex was beyond ready to pee. He’d been crossing his legs for so long that they’d fallen asleep, and his fingers had been digging against his thighs. He unlatched his seatbelt, and when the strap pulled away from his aching bladder he released a heavy sigh. He hadn’t even noticed how much that thing had been digging into him until it was suddenly gone.

He carefully exited the car, gently placing his feet down on the ground. As he rose up, his brief respite abruptly ended and he was feeling the full brunt of his need once again. His bladder felt heavy and stretched out, a tautness just below his navel that made him fidget where he stood.

Adam got out as well and stretched. “Finally…” he said. “I didn’t think we’d ever get through all of that.”

Alex nodded as Adam went to grab some of the presents from the backseat. Alex really had to go… But, it wouldn’t be fair to make Adam do this all by himself. Besides, it would be awful embarrassing to burst into the house and run straight for the toilet. Alex could hold off for a little bit longer. Now that he was close to a bathroom again, he didn’t see a reason to worry himself over it.

Alex took an armload of the gifts and he and Adam went up to the front door. Adam clumsily rang the bell, trying not to drop everything he was carrying. Alex’s Mom answered a moment later and welcomed them inside. They placed all of the presents underneath the tree, said hello to Alex’s grandmother, and finally Alex turned to head towards one of the restrooms.

Before he could make the first step, he was mobbed by his younger brother and sisters. “Alex! You’re here” Charity cheered, hugging him tightly.

“What did you bring us?” Ben asked.

“Don’t be so rude, Ben!” Prudence scolded.

“Alex!” Mary grinned and hugged him from his other side.

Alex smiled at all of them. He was happy to see them, honestly! Just, now that Mary was clinging to his legs like that, he couldn’t CROSS them, and he suddenly wanted to do that really bad. It didn’t help that Charity’s arms were wrapped right around his bladder, and that her hugs were usually super tight. He felt like a balloon being stepped on.

“W—We were stuck in traffic a while,” Alex tried to explain, something in him insisting that he needed to JUSTIFY his desire for a pee break. Like, if he didn’t have a decent enough reason for his bladder to be full, they’d somehow all be able to guess that he’d failed to hold it in last night.

It didn’t matter what he said anyway, because nobody heard him. They all kept chattering at him, arguing with one another over who would get to play with Alex first.

“Come on, Alex,” Ben said. “I want to—“

“Ben wants to play a GROSS game,” Prudence interrupted. “Alex should come draw with me!”

“I wanna show him my presents!” Charity whined.

Alex started to run a hand through his hair anxiously as Charity led him over to the little tea set she’d received earlier that morning.

Alex crouched beside her, grateful that the cup being offered to him was only filled with imaginary liquid. If only the fluid in his bladder could be imaginary, too. Kneeling down had really upset the still filling organ. He knew he had to come up with a way to get to the bathroom soon without having to announce it…

Adam watched Alex playing with his little sister, paying particular attention to the hand his fiancé kept moving up to his pony-tail. Adam knew now what it meant when Alex fiddled with his hair like that, and assumed Alex would be excusing himself once Charity grew bored of the game.

Alex had been hoping to do that, but before he had a chance, Grandma said it was time for everyone to start getting ready for church. So, rather than peeing, Alex’s next several minutes were taken up by helping all of the little ones get dressed, and making sure that THEY all used the toilet before they left. Every time the bathroom door shut, the sound of the lock clicking felt like a kick to Alex’s bladder.

He made himself wait AWAY from the restroom, so that he wouldn’t have to hear the toilet flushing, so that he wouldn’t start squirming and jiggling beside the door, so that it wouldn’t be brutally obvious that he was beginning to get desperate for some relief.

Adam watched Alex standing awkwardly in the living room as he waited for one of the restrooms to free up. Alex’s legs had crossed together in a way that looked almost casual— If he weren’t messing with his hair, Adam wouldn’t have thought he needed to go.

Several minutes later, Ben, Prudence, Charity and Mary were all ready to leave. Alex ushered them out to their Mom’s van, helped Mary into her car-seat, and all the while Adam kept waiting for him to turn back around and go use the bathroom.

He didn’t… He just got right into the van. Confused, Adam took the seat beside him. So, maybe Alex DIDN’T have to pee…? Before Adam could allow himself to think that, Alex was bouncing his legs, fanning his knees in and out. “Sweet thing…?” He whispered. “You sure you’re ready to go?”

Alex nodded. His siblings had all taken so long to get ready, he didn’t want to make the family late just because he wanted a bathroom break. He’d go once they got to the church.

Once everyone was in the van and Mom began the drive, Alex fought back his whimpers. He’d forgotten how much bouncier a big van was compared to a little, electric car like Adam’s… And, of course he’d stupidly decided to sit in the back— The worst seat to take when in need of a toilet. ‘It won’t be long,’ he thought. Just a few minutes, and then he’d be at a urinal, freeing himself from the growing tension inside of him.

His desperation was blatant to Adam. Alex was chewing his lip, fidgeting his hips in all directions, bouncing his knee up and down. When they went over a bump in the road, Alex gasped softly and bent forwards, posture radiating with urgency.

They got to the church and everyone filed in for the service. It was a lot more crowded today than it usually was— The people who didn’t attend that often still always showed up on Christmas. It took a while to find an area with enough vacancy for all of them to sit down, and when Alex took his place, his bladder cramped and stabbed at him sharply.

This would likely be the best opportunity to use the bathroom Alex would get all day. Right now, he didn’t even have to SAY that he was going to the toilet to be able to be excused. He could tell everyone he was going somewhere ELSE, and so long as they didn’t follow, they wouldn’t know he’d needed to pee— They wouldn’t have any reason to think about him peeing. They wouldn’t have any reason to wonder if he’d had any accidents recently.

Alex stood, the liquid within him rushing downwards and causing him to stumble. “I am going to… Uh… Try and grab some of the cookies before they run out,” he said.

His Mom waved him off and Alex hurried out of the room. He was staring down at the ground, watching his feet. His legs buzzed so much with the need to squirm, and he was worried he’d trip if he wasn’t careful. After a few more turns, he released an involuntary groan at the sight of a very long line. It was so massive that it wrapped around the wall in an L shape, and when Alex took his spot at the back of it, he couldn’t even SEE the door to the men’s room he needed. “Mmmf…” he whimpered, crossing his legs.

When he saw the knot he was tying himself in, he blushed fiercely and tried to straighten out. There was only one reason a person would be contorting themselves like that while standing in line for a toilet. Anyone who laid eyes on him would know he needed to pee, they’d know how badly he needed to pee and, somehow, they’d know that he’d peed his bed last night.

The hand that had been just about to make contact with his crotch curled around his waistband instead and he told himself to wait. Patience was a virtue, after all. Alex should do his best to display such behavior at ALL times, but especially in church… Although he doubted ‘Be patient when you’re bursting to pee and you have to wait through, like, forty people before you can use a urinal’ was really what God had meant…

Alex tried to be patient— He thought he WAS most of the time! He didn’t frustrate easily, and he was alright if someone else did something a little too slowly and he had to wait on them. Usually, anyway. Right now, everyone ahead of him seemed to be taking WAY too long to use the restroom, and it was so HARD to wait. Even if Alex wanted to be virtuous and calm, his BLADDER had other ideas. It had no time for patience, it wanted Alex to shove his way through the agonizingly long line and finally EMPTY it.

He leaned against the wall, kneeling slightly. He hoped that looked normal enough— He hoped it didn’t make him LOOK like he was dying to shove past everybody so that he could finally go! The line was just INCHING forwards, and sweat kept rolling down the back of Alex’s neck. He stared up at the ceiling, hitching his hips and clenching his thighs.

Ten minutes later, Alex could tell that he still had AGES left until he’d be in front of a toilet. The service had probably started already, and since he’d mentioned getting cookies, his siblings were probably anxiously anticipating him coming back with some. At the rate the line was moving, he’d probably still be waiting by the time the service ended…

He didn’t WANT to leave his spot in line, it had grown in the time he’d been standing in it. He had to go so badly now that he was no longer able to conceal it. He kept wriggling, kept crossing his legs, caught himself nearly cupping his crotch a few times, too. He NEEDED to stay in line until he FINALLY got to take his turn.

He stayed in place for a couple more minutes, then he gave up. It would probably be faster just to hold it until he got back to Mom’s place! Limping from the line and biting back a groan when his bladder gave a confused, angry pang, Alex found the tables of food that had been set up and grabbed a few cookies. At first, he only got enough for his siblings, but then he grabbed an extra one for Adam.

***

Adam had been struggling to pay attention to the church service. It helped that he already KNEW the story of the first Christmas well enough, but the old-timey words used in the Bible still got confusing. He wondered how in the world Alex managed to understand when they read from OTHER parts of it that hadn’t been re-told in movies and TV shows hundreds of times.

He was also beginning to wonder what was taking Alex so long. He KNEW his fiancé hadn’t actually left in search of cookies, but peeing shouldn’t take THIS long, right? He was beginning to worry something bad had happened. Alex felt extremely safe here. He talked all the time about how open, loving and accepting this church was. But with as many people here as there were today, maybe Alex had run into someone who WASN’T nice.

Adam was about to get up and go searching for him, when he saw Alex coming back to his seat, cookies in his hands, and his bladder obviously STILL brimming. Alex’s steps were tiny, the sorts of movements a person would make when trying to carry a very full cup of water without spilling it. He was grimacing, sweaty, and shaking. HAD someone caused him trouble in the restroom…?

“Alex—“

Alex sat down, eyes going wide and a tiny squeak falling from his lips. He bent forwards at the waist, then handed Adam one of the cookies. “H—Here.”

“Alex—“

“Alex!” Prudence whispered, a little too loudly. “Can I have one, too?”

“Y—Yeah,” Alex handed her one, then passed out the rest. Now that his hands were empty, it was incredibly difficult not to put them between his legs. His knees jiggled, he leaned against Adam, searching for any kind of comfort.

Adam took a bite of his cookie, then gripped Alex’s hand. “Are you okay?” He asked softly.

Alex shook his head, and his answer was barely audible; “The line for the bathroom is really, really long…”

Oh… Adam almost felt a little relieved when he heard that. Alex was safe, just super desperate for a piss and unable to go. He rubbed Alex’s arm, trying to soothe him, though he really wasn’t sure how to help. The line must have been atrocious if Alex had decided to just leave it without peeing. “Are there other restrooms?”

“No,” Alex said, miserable. “I— I’ll wait…” He tangled his legs together, tucked his hands beneath his thighs, sitting on them so that he wouldn’t grab himself.

Adam hoped he could…

Alex had been desperate to pee during church services LOADS of times before. There had been plenty of occasions where he’d just needed to relieve himself and Papa wouldn’t allow him to get up to take care of it. He could still vividly remember an incident that took place at his old church when he was much, much younger. All the little kids were being read a picture book about Noah and the great flood, and Alex was having what he considered to be his first REAL emergency. He kept waving his hand around, eyes going wide and watery, but no one asked him what was wrong or told him he could go to the bathroom. He’d MOSTLY managed to make it, but when Papa saw that he’d gotten his skirt a little wet, he’d been in lots of trouble.

Then, when he got older, there was the time the door to the restroom at his old church wouldn’t come open. He’d had to hold a dangerously full bladder through the entire service, and every time they paused to pray, Alex could only think to pray for the door to start working again so he could go. The praying must have worked, because the door swung right open the next time Alex tried it, but it had been a seriously close call.

This time, his need felt even more dire. Getting up, going to the restroom, and being denied access to it by the line had teased his poor bladder, had made it angry. Alex hoped that maybe the line would be mostly gone by the time they were getting ready to leave. He’d… He’d have to tell everybody to wait on him while he went, though! They’d know it was an emergency then, too, because the ride back to his Mom’s house was only about twenty minutes!   Ohhh, that would be so embarrassing! But, the very THOUGHT of getting back into the bouncy van with his bladder even FULLER made him feel like he’d spring a leak!

The service was pretty long, like it always was on Christmas. It felt so much longer this year, though. Alex could feel every drop of liquid stretching him out. He kept wriggling in his seat, accidentally kicking Adam a few times. Twice, he nearly shot to his feet and ran back towards the restrooms to see if the line was any better. But, he knew if he got up he’d immediately be doubling over, clutching himself, and as the only person standing, it would be easy to notice…

Alex was blinking back tears when the service ended, stunned that he’d made it through without at least dribbling into his pants. Everyone started to stand up. Alex’s Mom helped his Grandmother to her feet, and Adam had to help Alex with the same thing; His desperation affecting his ability to move as badly as aging joints would have.

Alex kept clinging to Adam’s hand as they began to leave, and he felt a weight lift off his shoulders when Charity said that she needed to “go potty”. Prudence chimed in that she had to pee as well, and so did Mary and Ben. Alex exhaled, of course the younger ones would have to go after sitting still for so long. It only made sense that they’d stop at the restrooms before heading home— Alex could relieve himself without having to single himself out, or admit that it was an emergency.

Then they actually got TO the restrooms, and Alex’s hope died. The line for the men’s had somehow gotten even longer, and the one for the women’s was at least twice as bad. Alex worried at his lip, stepping lightly between his feet as he stared miserably at the mass of people separating him from badly needed relief. He hoped he could hold MOSTLY still beside Ben as they waited, and—

“I can wait ’til home,” Charity said.

And Alex’s chest clenched along with his bladder. Heat bloomed on his face, and dampened his boxers. He’d finally lost a spurt, and at the exact moment his MUCH younger sister had announced that SHE could hold it until they got home. “A—Are you sure?” He managed to force out.

“Uh-huh,” Charity said.

“Th—The rest of—“

Prudence nodded, and Mary copied her.

“Yeah,” Ben said. “I’m fine.”

Adam watched as Alex’s blush spread down his neck, panic filling his wide eyes. It was obvious that ONE of the siblings DIDN’T think he could make it home in time…

Mom started walking again. “Alright, lets’s—“

Wanting to spare Alex some embarrassment, Adam spoke up, “Um… I’m real sorry, but I need to go sorta bad, actually…”

Mom looked back and forth from Adam to the line for the men’s room. “It will take you just as long to get through the line as it will for us to get home… Do you think you can try to make it?”

“Er…” Adam did his best to look uncertain, copying a few of the jiggling bounces Alex was doing, performing them in a much more exaggerated manner. “I— I don’t know, honestly. I’m kinda bursting for it.”

Charity giggled, causing Adam to blush even though he WASN’T actually having an emergency. “You can have the first turn,” she said.

“Uh—Um… Okay…” Adam said, accepting that his ploy wasn’t going to help Alex.

Everyone got into the van. Alex was careful NOT to sit in the back this time, tucking himself against Adam as they drove off. Adam did his best to use his body as a bit of a shield for Alex, giving him some privacy to fidget. Every time they hit a bump, Adam squeezed Alex’s arm, trying to assure him that it would be okay.

Alex’s legs knotted together, scissored back and forth, and he finally gave in and grabbed his crotch when a large bump in the road made his bladder jolt so forcefully that a jet of pee splashed into his boxers. His eyes blew wide open and his pupils darted back and forth, fearful that someone had heard his leaking.

Adam had, and he was pretty sure he was the only one that had, but just in case the hissing had been loud and clear to everybody, Adam grabbed himself and moaned to give the illusion that HE’D been the one to momentarily lose control of himself. “Ohhhh….”

Prudence, giggled from the back. “Is Adam gonna pee in his pants?”

“I— I hope not…” Adam grunted, tapping his feet frantically. “But, I gotta be at a bathroom soon!”

Alex’s Grandmother turned around to look at him. “Oh, dear… It’s not hurting, is it?”

Adam tried not to look at Alex, tried not to speculate on whether or not HE was feeling pain. He just shook his head. “No, but I— I just need a toilet fast, okay?”

“We’ll be there in a few minutes,” Alex’s Mom said. “Hang in there.”

Alex whimpered into Adam’s shoulder, curling his fingers around his arm as Adam stroked him gently again.

Once back at the house, Alex stayed clinging to Adam as the others got out of the van. His Grandmother turned back around, “Do you need Alex to help you stand?” She asked.

“Y—Yeah,” Adam said, starting to bounce his knees again. It was sort of hard to remember to pee dance when he didn’t actually need to go…

Alex was having no trouble remembering. He was shuddering beside Adam, eyes squeezed closed. Adam waited a couple moments, then gingerly helped him to his feet outside. Everyone else had already gone in, giving Alex all the privacy he needed to wriggle and clutch himself, sweat cascading down his forehead in spite of the cold, Winter air. Once Alex had a better handle on himself, Adam assisted him with taking slow, careful steps back through the front door. “I’ll use the bathroom further from the door,” Adam whispered to him. “You use the other.”

Alex nodded as Adam opened the door for him and ushered him inside.

Adam, still trying to keep up the pretense that HE was the one about to explode, said “Ah— Th—Thanks, Alex—Oooh— I c—can barely walk!” He grabbed himself, rushing for one of the bathrooms as if he really WERE about to burst.

Alex straightened himself out painfully, he only had to make it about twenty steps without either peeing himself or breaking out in a desperate, obvious dance. He walked on stiff-legs, his bladder bouncing with each step, slamming all around inside his body and issuing the occasional drip into his boxers.

When he got the restroom, the door was shut and he could hear a stream flowing into the toilet. His abdominal muscles all tightened and his crossed his legs, his balance going wobbly. When he heard the toilet flush, he bent over in an agonized curtsey. ‘My turn next, please…?’ He thought.

The door opened, and Charity walked out. Alex looked back and forth, Mary was standing outside the door to the restroom Adam was using, Prudence was behind her… Alex could go now, right? Did he have to offer to let them use it first? He— He NEEDED it so much more… He was bursting, his crotch felt damp, he was coming apart at his seams, he had to—

Ben started to head into the bathroom ahead of him, and Alex winced, barely aware he was speaking; “I— I was nex—“

“Alex,” Ben said. “Can you hang out with me now?”

Alex’s lip trembled. He didn’t have time for any more delays. “I—“

“I wanna play a game with you,” Ben said.

Alex remembered Prudence bemoaning Ben’s desire to play some ‘gross game’. He was curious, but not curious enough to continue putting off his pee break. “But—“

“Do you have to use the bathroom at all?” Ben asked.

Alex’s trembling ceased for a second as a furious blush overtook his face. He supposed he probably HADN’T been hiding it that well these last few moments, and without Adam there to hide him, the tension in his body and the rocking of his feet would be easy to see.

“If you don’t, can you go drink something?” Ben requested. “‘Cause, I already need to go, and I wanted to sword-fight with you!”

“Wh—What?!” Alex breathed, chest and shoulders scorching pink.

“I—It’s a game,” Ben said. “We pee together, and—“

“I— I know what it is!” Alex said. He’d played this game with Adam a couple times, and he would welcome the opportunity to play it now— He’d get to relieve himself without confessing to how desperate he was. “A—And… Yes. I guess I could go now.”

“So, can we play?” Ben asked, hopeful. “Come on, I’ve wanted to ever since you first said you were gonna start being my brother now! I mean, it was the first thing I thought of!”

Alex nodded eagerly, “Y—Yeah, we can play!” He said. “I’d love to!” He gripped the edge of his shirt with his hands, trying so hard not to hold his crotch again. He followed Ben into the restroom, biting down hard on his lip when he saw the toilet. He wasn’t able to stop the little whimpering moan when shooting pangs of urgency bolted through his body. He crossed his legs back together, ankles rubbing and thighs twitching. He was certain that Ben could tell now.

But, Ben wasn’t looking at him, he was busy lifting the lid and seat on the toilet. “It’s alright,” he said in response to Alex’s distressed sounds. “If some gets on the floor, I’ll clean it, since this was my idea.”

Alex hurried up to the toilet, one hand at his zipper, poised to yank it down. His fingers toyed with the pull tab, his bladder fluttering at the sight of the bowl. It took everything he had not to plead with Ben to hurry up. Alex had never been so excited to play a game before.

Ben stood next to him, and when Alex heard his zipper being moved, he frantically got his own clothing apart and aimed. It only took one second for his stream to start exploding out of him, noisily cascading into the bowl and instantly filling him with a light, loose, floaty feeling. Then, he was shivering, sighing and panting with relief as his body shook.

“You were supposed to wait for me to tell you to start…” Ben mumbled, snapping Alex back to reality, reminding him that he WASN’T alone, enjoying his relief in solitude.

A second stream appeared beside his own, and quickly crossed over it. Alex tried to engage Ben in the silly game, but he was far, far more focused on how good it felt to finally just GO. His bladder almost felt like it was rippling, his lower abdomen being lightly massaged as more and more pee was ejected out of him.

“Whoever pees the longest wins,” Ben said, laughing. “And, I drank lots of sodas before church, so it’s gonna be real hard for you to beat me!”

Alex doubted he’d have much of a challenge… And he thought he should probably scold Ben for drinking so much and then holding it, not that he was really one to talk about that today. He’d gotten dangerously close to overflowing— He HAD overflowed, really, he’d leaked multiple times, the clamminess of his boxers was still noticeable.

Of course, Ben finished up first, and he seemed to be both disappointed and surprised by that. “Whoa…” he said. “You’re still going?”

Alex shivered again, much more from embarrassment than relief. “Y—Yeah…” he said. He didn’t think he was close to finished, either. He could still feel his bladder deflating, could still feel the bloated organ shrinking down to a more manageable size. Some of the haziness was fading from his mind now, he was able to process things that weren’t related to how badly he needed to pee, or how amazing it was to actually go. He was able to actually think about things he’d glossed right over moments ago.

Specifically, Ben saying that his very first thought after Alex had come out as trans had, apparently, just been about getting to play a peeing game with him… Alex remembered how scary it was to tell his siblings; Jed and Patience, the two oldest, had both rejected him like Papa had and he never saw them anymore. The littlest ones hadn’t thought too much of it, to them it was simple; At first, Alex was their sister, and now he was their brother. He was the same person who’d tucked them into bed every night and played with them, he just looked different than he’d used to.

Ben was the middle child, and his initial reaction had been hard for Alex to figure out because he hadn’t SAID anything, and his facial expression had been unreadable, blank. In the time since, he’d always called Alex “he” and his “brother”, but they’d never talked about it and Alex had worried if, deep down, Ben didn’t like to think about it.

Now though, Alex was sure there was no problem. Ben was happy to have Alex as a brother, and had only ever been thinking about the “guy stuff” they could do together now. As he finished peeing at last, Alex shivered one more time and felt his chest heating up. This time, the warmth had nothing to do with embarrassment.

Ben probably had no clue how good he’d just made Alex feel, in so many ways.

Alex turned to the sink as Ben spoke up again. “Woooow, that was a lot!” He said. “I really didn’t think you’d beat me, ‘cause I honestly had to go bad by the time we got home, but… I’ve never gone THAT much all at once before!”

Alex turned red. “Er… Well, I’m… Bigger than you, so my bladder’s probably bigger, too.”

“I guess…” Ben said. “But… that was ‘I guess I could go now’?” He repeated Alex’s words from earlier. “I would have thought you’d been about to have an accident!”

Alex looked away. “Eheh… Uh, I guess I had to pee worse than I’d thought. All of Adam’s squirming must have rubbed off!” He tugged at his hair anxiously. “Um… Speaking of him, I’d better make sure he made it alright.” He left the restroom, finding Adam resting on the couch. He sat beside him and gave him a quick hug.

Adam hugged back, “You feeling better now?” He whispered.

“Yeah,” Alex said. “Thanks for… For pretending that you were the one having an emergency.”

“No problem.”

Written for the 12 Days of Omo prompt "While Caroling".

***

Soon after Alex and Ben had finished in the restroom, it was time for Alex to pass out the gifts he’d gotten for everyone. It warmed his heart to see how happy his siblings all were with their presents. He was especially delighted when Ben broke into a grin at the sight of the drawing supplies he unwrapped. Ben loved drawing, and back when they’d lived with Papa, he hadn’t been allowed to do it. Papa said drawing was something only girls were supposed to do. Now, Alex wanted to make sure Ben had lots of opportunities to explore his hobby, and that no one ever shamed him for it again.

Then, it was time for dinner. Adam liked the way Alex’s Mom cooked, and he was very happy that she always tried vegetarian recipes when he was visiting. This evening, she’d prepared roasted cauliflower and lasagna. The little kids all liked the lasagna, but seemed wary of the cauliflower. Prudence said it looked “like a brain,” making Adam snort with laughter. He ate some of the cauliflower to show her it wasn’t bad, surprised by the amount of pepper in it. He found himself reaching for his water glass often as he ate, both to combat the pepper and to help quell his nerves.

After dinner, he and Alex were going to announce their engagement.

Adam had to get up to re-fill his glass three times before he was through with his meal, and then one more time while they had dessert. When he took Alex’s hand and they stood up together, Adam was immediately aware of a tightness in his lower belly. Downing four glasses of water in under an hour had apparently convinced his kidneys to work overtime…

“W—We had something we wanted to say,” Alex began. “It’s… Um… It’s exciting…” He squeezed Adam’s hand.

“Y—Yeah,” Adam said, butterflies fluttering in his stomach, pressing dangerously close to his bladder. He would have preferred to have done this when he DIDN’T need a bathroom sort of badly, but now that Alex had set the stage for a big, grand announcement, no way was he going to blurt out ‘I have to pee!’ He could hold it in for a few more minutes easily. “A— A little while ago… Alex asked me to marry him.”

The reaction was immediate, at one end of the table, Alex’s Grandmother was beaming. His Mom was clapping, and his siblings were all asking a myriad of questions.

“Did you say yes?!” Prudence demanded. “You have to say yes!”

“Does that mean you’re gonna be our brother, too?!” Ben asked.

“When’s the wedding?!” Charity cried. “I love weddings! Can I be the flower girl?!”

“No, me!” Said Mary.

“I—I did say yes,” Adam continued, sitting back down and rubbing a hand over his sore middle. “It was actually kinda funny… I’d been just about to ask him the same thing… And, yeah, I guess once we’re married, I’ll be you guys’s brother, too. And… We don’t know when the wedding’s gonna be, or what it’ll be like yet. We just wanted to let you all know.”

A lot of discussion followed. Alex’s Mom had lots of suggestions for where they could have their wedding, and what foods they could have, what music to play… By the time the excitement died off, Adam REALLY had to pee and was frantically tapping his feet beneath the table. He couldn’t think of anything regarding the wedding, aside from the fact he wanted it to take place somewhere with lots of bathrooms, and that he needed to make sure the suit he picked didn’t have very many buttons over the fly.

He finally had a chance to run to the toilet when Prudence asked if they could go caroling again this year and everyone’s attention turned to her. Adam pushed back his chair, “E—Excuse me,” he said, climbing to his feet and wincing at how heavy his bladder felt inside him.

A minute later, he’d locked himself in one of the restrooms. He unzipped his pants and aimed a thin, crystal clear stream of liquid into the toilet, sighing deeply as the walls of his bladder compressed and his tension eased. “Ahhhh….” His pee was devoid of any color, he was basically just letting out pure water— He was well BEYOND hydrated, and had a feeling he’d be making quite a few runs for the toilet as all this liquid filtered through him.

Once he’d finished and left the bathroom, he found Alex helping Charity into a thick coat. Prudence was already wearing hers, Ben and Mary were still in the kitchen. “Adam, you wanna come with us?” Alex asked.

Adam struggled to remember where they were going— He’d been far more focused on pissing earlier. “Oh, caroling, right?”

“Yeah,” Alex said. “Ben thinks it’s lame, and Mary’s still too little, but these two LOVE it, so I’m gonna take them down a few streets.”

Adam nodded, if Alex was going out, he’d go too. “Alright, but I’m not gonna sing.”

“Awww,” Prudence said.

“BELIEVE me,” Adam told her. “You don’t WANT me to.”

Alex snickered, “Yeah, Adam’s singing voice is more suited for a metal band than it is for ‘O Holy Night…’”

With Charity bundled up, Alex tugged on his own coat and handed Adam his. Adam put it on, laughing. “Oh, Alex— Did I ever tell you? When I was little, there was this Christmas party at the hospital where my Dad was working…” He pushed open the front door and stepped into the chilly Winter air, a shiver knotting in his abdomen and catching him off guard for a second.

“Uh— Well, at the party, they got me to sing because they thought it was cute. And, like, everyone was saying I had ‘the voice of an angel’, and that I sounded so soothing I could sing babies to sleep and stuff. And then, for years after, my parents would have me sing all these super calming, New Age songs, and they’d say stuff about me being the next Enya.” He walked down the street alongside Alex and his siblings, his shoes trudging in the snow, and a buzzing filling his bladder. ‘I can’t seriously need to go again THIS fast, can I?’ He wondered.

“And, my voice stayed like that for a long time, but then when I was old enough to be on testosterone… Like, I think only a month later, my parents were all ‘Well, he’s not gonna be Enya NOW, is he? He’s gonna have to be in Deftones instead.’”

Alex laughed, feeling a touch warmer from the story. Adam hadn’t been the person his parents had expected, and instead of being upset, they’d just rolled with it, adjusted their expectations instead of trying to adjust Adam. Why were some parents like Adam’s, but other parents like Papa?

They got to the first house and rang the doorbell, Prudence and Charity performed their rendition of a few Christmas songs, earning plenty of cooing “Awwww”s from the occupants of the home.

As they walked away from that house, the pressure inside Adam’s body grew. He really DID have to pee again. It couldn’t have been more than ten minutes since he’d last used the toilet, but he already felt full enough that he was eagerly anticipating his next visit.

They’d JUST left, if Adam told them all to turn back around already, he’d be met with disappointed groans. Seeing as how he’d already emptied his bladder once this hour, he was sure he could make it until the next to go again. His need was worsening at a pretty alarming pace, but it HAD to slow back down and plateau eventually.

They went to every house on this street, and Adam smiled as he watched Prudence and Charity have their fun. He’d been worried some of the neighbors would get annoyed with this, but the girls were apparently still young enough that everything they did was cute— Even knocking on people’s doors around dinner time just to sing to them.

The only problem was that Alex was STILL waiting on that ‘plateau’ he’d been hoping for. With every passing minute, his need for the toilet got worse and worse. The cold weather wasn’t helping him at all, every time he shivered, the liquid inside him was shaken up, the sensitive walls of his bladder strained and he had to tense his thighs against the pressure.

They turned onto the next street, and Adam began to ponder if he should ask someone to use their restroom. He didn’t want to trouble anybody, but his bladder was REALLY aching now. He’d needed to pause in his strides a few times to cross his legs, hoping that the action would go unnoticed by his companions.

At the next house, Adam watched the girls sing and tried to think of a good way to request the toilet. Standing still as Prudence and Charity performed wasn’t helping his need at all. His bladder throbbed and throbbed, the pressure at his opening weighing heavily, his right foot was tapping involuntarily.

Alex watched Adam fidgeting, and assumed his fiancé was getting too cold. Once the door to the house was closed, Alex pulled Adam in for a close, tight hug, furrowing his brown in confusion when Adam immediately went stiff in his arms.

“You want to wear my coat, too?” Alex asked.

Adam shook his head, “I— I’m fine,” he said. “You keep it.” He felt a little better once they’d started walking again. His bladder was being rocked back and forth with each step, but that didn’t hurt as bad as standing still did. When they stopped at a house, it was just awful. Not only did he have to hold it, he also had to work harder to hide the fact that he was doing so.

By the time they were done with the second street, Adam was beginning to doubt his ability to hold it much longer. Heat that was far too wet for his comfort kept appearing between his legs, forcing him to stop in his tracks. Icy fear kept knotting in his body, the unmistakable dampness of his leaks sending adrenaline scorching through him.

He leaned into Alex, whom held his hand gently. “I can give you my coat,” Alex reminded. The cold was the only explanation he could think of for why Adam was walking so oddly, bending over at his waist, stopping short, stepping in place quickly. He must have just been trying to get more heat back into his body. “I don’t mind.”

“I—I’m not cold,” Adam said.

Alex sighed, his warm breath forming a cloud in the air. It wasn’t like Adam to deny things like that, he’d never been one to act tough in order to convince others he was ‘macho’. “Adam—“

“I just have to go to the bathroom,” Adam told him. “That’s all. Don’t worry about it.”

“Oh…” Alex looked down, now seeing Adam’s twitchy legs in a new light. “You wanna head back now?”

“What!?” Prudence whined, overhearing.

“Awwww…” Charity chimed in. “Not yet!”

Alex held his hands up. “Adam needs to—“

“I can hold it,” Adam interrupted, sounding way more certain than he felt. The kids were having so much fun, he didn’t want to make them cut it short just because his bladder was bothering him. “I went right before we left, so I should be fine.” He SHOULD have been, but he wasn’t. The pulses from beneath his fly were screaming at him, telling him that he was very, VERY far from fine.

“Yay!” Charity and Prudence cheered.

Alex squeezed Adam’s hand. “Are you sure?” He whispered.

Adam tensed up his thighs and wriggled his hips. “Yeah, I’ll be alright.”

Once on the next street, time seemed to be slowing down for Adam. All of the songs Prudence and Charity sang became indecipherable gibberish as soon as they hit his ears. On top of that, his own breathing seemed to be getting louder with every exhale, to the point where after a few minutes, he could hear his breath as loud as a door being slammed. An absolutely atrocious increase in the pressure he was battling seemed to coincide with the amplifying volume. He had no idea if it was the result of more water slamming against his opening, or just the slow weakening of his holding muscles.

Coiling his legs together as he stood on a stranger’s porch, he let out a quiet, shaking groan as he tried to steady himself. In the end, all this discomfort and pressure would be worth something, wouldn’t it? He’d get back to the house in time, be at the toilet, unzipped, gushing away and feeling absolutely incredible.

Following his thoughts, his full bladder squeezed in on itself with enough force that his heart began to beat rapid-fire. There was more wet heat between his legs, but he wasn’t sure if it was another leaking squirt of pee, or sweat from the strain of trying to hold it all back. He grabbed his crotch for a second, savoring the relief this brought. He stared up at the owner of this house, his eyes wide, begging. He hoped the person would just… Notice that he had to go, offer him the bathroom.

Of course, they didn’t. He was going to have to ask. When Charity and Prudence bowed before the woman, Adam opened his mouth. “E—Excuse me, may I—“

“Ohhhh,” the woman cooed, bending down to the girls. “You two are just precious!”

Charity giggled and Prudence beamed.

“Did Santa bring you lots of presents today?”

“Uh-huh,” Charity said.

Adam cleared his throat, shifting on his feet and sloshing everything inside of him once more. The waves of piss crashed down, bearing its full weight against the tiny ring of muscle responsible for keeping it at bay. He almost doubled over, every shuffle of his feet prompted the same reaction from his bladder, but he couldn’t hold still. Even as his pee-dancing hurt him a lot more than it helped, he just couldn’t hold still!

“I bet he did…” the woman was saying. “You’re both very good girls, aren’t you?”

“Excuse me…” Adam tried again, attempting to speak up. It wasn’t easy, so much of his energy was too busy preventing his piss from flowing down his legs. Every muscle in his lower body was straining to hold back the flood that was fighting its hardest to escape. He straightened up, trying to be seen better, and immediately his urge felt WORSE, which was definitely the fault of gravity, but it was so intense that it felt like something was working with malicious intent to increase the downward pull for the sole purpose of torturing Adam.

The woman was still just so enamored with the kids, though… It was like Adam wasn’t there, it was like he hadn’t said anything!

Alex took Adam’s hand and rubbed it gently. HE’D been able to hear him. “Ma’am?” Alex asked, clearing his throat.

She looked up finally, and stared at Adam whom was crossing and recrossing his legs, a look of pure panic and need upon his face. Alex was SURE that she was about to offer him the bathroom, but instead she said “Well, all of you have a nice evening,” and shut the door.

Adam groaned when he heard the lock click, the sound was like a punch to his bladder, painful in its finality.

Prudence and Charity turned around now, and Adam was no longer able to behave in a way that made it look like he wasn’t holding back a typhoon of urine. “Do you have to tinkle?” Prudence asked.

‘Tinkle’ was not a strong enough word for what Adam had to do. The aching, wailing pressure in his middle was serious and called for a serious term; He needed to PISS. He still managed a nod and a miserable shrug. “I was trying to ask her if I could use her toilet.”

“Adam, do you want to head back now?” Alex asked.

“Awwww,” Charity pouted.

“Adam REALLY has to go to the bathroom,” Alex said.

“He can go at someone’s house,” Charity said.

“He should have gone before we left,” Prudence repeated something Mom had doubtlessly told HER many times before.

“I did…” Adam mumbled. “But, it’s fine. I’m fine. I can wait a little bit longer.”

Alex worried at his lip, “Adam—“

“E—End of this street,” Adam said. “We’ll stop after this street. I can handle that. Is that okay?”

The girls nodded, and Adam followed after them, hoping that his mouth wouldn’t turn out to be bigger than his bladder.

He was okay through the next couple houses. He desperately needed to relieve himself, but he didn’t feel the threatening tremble warning him that he was about to go in his pants. At the third house, it was taking all of his strength not to jam his hands between his legs. He was bursting at the seams, and again he tried to get the home owners’ attention in the hopes that he would be granted freedom from his agony.

This time, the girls were singing for an elderly couple. Adam hoped that meant they’d be more sympathetic, behave like grandparents and let him pee before he exploded all over their front porch. He waited for Prudence and Charity to finish, then he spoke as loudly as he could “E—Excuse me, I—“

“Adam has to tinkle real bad,” Charity laughed.

Adam reddened, but nodded frantically. “I— I do,” he said. “May I please use your restroom really fast?”

The old man turned to his wife, whom said “Of course you may,” and immediately Adam was exhaling with relief.

“Ah, thank you,” Adam said, pushing his way forwards. “Thank you so much, thankyouthankyou…”

The old man put his hand up to stop him. “Shoes off in the house,” he said.

Adam tried not to frown at this additional obstacle, this extra thing he would have to wait through. They were kind enough to let him use their toilet, if they didn’t want him wearing shoes on their carpet, he shouldn’t complain. His bladder DID complain though, when he crouched down to unlace his shoes, his bladder complained a LOT. Tears dotted the edges of his eyes as his waistband compressed his midsection with a fury he didn’t think he’d ever known before. “Hnnnn…” he grunted involuntarily, shoving one of his shoes off.

His dam was cracking under the strain, his opening shuddering against the pressure of the agonizingly loud call of nature. A drip slid out of him, followed by a spurt. He removed the other shoe and shot back up like a rubber band— Bad idea!

The sudden, rapid change in his position made another crack form in his crumbling defenses. A dribble rolled down his leg, warm and slick. The leaking made his pulse fire, “O—Okay!” He burst out. “M—May I go now?!”

The man stepped aside to allow him in, and the woman told him the restroom was to the left of the kitchen. Adam gave in to the need to grab himself, and plunged both hands between his legs as he rushed that way. He was already going loose at the thought of the upcoming relief, he grabbed the doorknob and tugged it open. Once he was inside and had gotten the door locked, he spun around on the spot, not daring to LOOK at the toilet until he was actually ready to USE it.

He had to get his clothes out of the way, just had to hang on until there were no longer fabric barriers doomed to bear the full brunt of what was sure to be a furious jet of liquid. Guh… Why did his coat have to go down to his crotch? He frantically fought with all the buttons, then yanked down the zipper, jumping from foot to foot the entire time, his desperation worsening to unimaginable new levels by this final obstruction to his relief.

He unbuttoned his pants, tore down his zip, and finally freed himself from his damp boxers. He turned to face the toilet and aimed his prosthetic for the— thankfully already open— bowl. He wondered briefly if the old lady ever yelled at the old man for leaving the seat up, but Adam was grateful to him for it, because he did NOT have a second to spare…

Or, at least, he’d THOUGHT he didn’t have a second to spare. Unfortunately, now that he was ready to pee, his bladder was suddenly remembering how to hold it. He bore down on his muscles, trying to force his stream out, but it didn’t work. He knew his sudden inability to void was probably down to him just simply having waited too long, and his body needing time to catch up and understand that it was finally safe to let go. But, that didn’t make it any less frustrating, didn’t make the pressure any less painful.

Finally, a slow stream started to flow forth, not at all the geyser he’d been expecting, but at least it was coming out. A few seconds later, his release had picked up speed and he was emptying a heavy, strong jet into the bowl. The sensation of releasing the burden at long last made him tremble, the hiss of it nearly echoing.

Again, his stream was completely clear, his body still over-hydrated— As if all his feelings of desperation hadn’t been enough to tell him that. The endless flow of water surged out without pause, and he grinned a satisfied smile as he groaned with pleasure. Sensing that he was approaching the end of his well overdue piss, he was almost a little disappointed. This felt so good that it made him wish it could go on for hours, but the relief setting in for him was wonderful, too.

As the gush finally slowed to a trickle, he pushed down and forced the last of it out. He closed the toilet lid and flushed, then zipped up and fixed his coat. Splashing some water onto his face at the sink, he tried to catch his breath. He exited the restroom and thanked the elderly couple again on his way out of the house. “Thank you, I’m real sorry.”

“Don’t be sorry,” the woman said. “I just hope you aren’t like Harold and you actually remembered to put the seat down.”

The man groaned, and Adam headed out the front door. Once it had shut behind him, he sighed again. “Ahhhh… You guys wanna finish with this street still?”

Prudence and Charity nodded, and they were on their way.

Alex took Adam’s hand again, pleased that he was no longer trembling.

(This one was commissioned. If you'd like a story of your own, feel free to DM me.)

***

Adam fought to keep his gaze AWAY from the sign he could see on the other side of the store. It was too tempting to look at. If he even allowed himself to GLANCE at it too many times, he didn’t think he’d be able to stop himself from going towards it.

Instead, he squeezed his eyes closed for a minute, trying to exorcise all images of urinals, toilets and running sinks from his brain. He ESPECIALLY tried to forget the sight, sound and FEELING of releasing an urgent stream. He tried not to think about how much he wanted to release one right now. He tried not to think about how he may end up spilling one down his legs soon.

He was going to explode. He needed to pee so bad that he could barely breathe. He was shifting from side to side, only managing to shake up the waves of urine crashing inside him, but unable to stop.

And there was a restroom that was just a two minute walk from his current position. If he sprinted, hands buried between his legs, he could probably make it in one and finally let go.

But, he wouldn’t.

He wouldn’t leave Alex alone for this. He hadn’t expected this to be difficult for him, but it clearly WAS, and Alex definitely wouldn’t feel safe by himself.

So, Adam would hold it.

This shouldn’t take too long.

Alex squirmed uncomfortably. He was excited to get a nice, fancy suit for his wedding, but he hadn’t known what exactly that would entail. He had a suit for church, and his Mom had bought him that one. It mostly fit him, though the sleeves were kind of long for his arms. He wanted something a little more fancy for what was going to be the most important day of his life.

He hadn’t realized that getting a new suit that went over his body PERFECTLY would involve so much… Touching. Alex hadn’t even realized it until just this very moment, but he didn’t like anyone’s hands on him aside from Adam’s. The man measuring him wasn’t doing anything objectionable, but Alex still didn’t like how this felt.

It was really unsettling to have a stranger pay so much attention to his body, even in a professional setting like this. Alex kept feeling himself going tense, and then he’d be told to relax so that the measurements would be more accurate.

The first time he flinched was when the tape measure was stretched across his chest. He didn’t know if he’d ever stop feeling anxious when a stranger got too close to that area. He knew there was nothing there to BE worried about anymore. If somebody touched his chest, they wouldn’t feel any lumpiness, their expression wouldn’t change to one of distrust or anger. But, Alex still always FELT like it would. Like, they’d somehow be able to feel just his SCARS through his shirt and the result would be the same.

That wariness had actually gotten a bit worse after the day at the store where Papa had pulled his shirt off and said all of those horrid things to him, told him he was disgusting… Was that what EVERYONE would think if they saw his scars? When the tailor’s knuckles brushed up against his chest, Alex inhaled sharply and ducked backwards without meaning to.

“I need you to hold still,” the tailor reminded.

“S—Sorry,” Alex said.

“H—He’s never done anything like this before,” Adam said, swaying and checking his watch, probably anxious for someone to begin taking HIS measurements. “He’s a little anxious.”

Alex was more than a little anxious. He, for some reason, felt like he was naked. The amount of attention being placed onto him was setting him so on edge that his skin was tingling. He tried his best NOT to feel so stressed out, he knew this was what everyone did to make sure their clothes fit them perfectly. The tailor hadn’t said or done anything he shouldn’t have, he really was just doing his job.

But, Alex couldn’t get over the discomfort. He was completely out of his element. Growing up, he’d done everything he could to avoid attracting the attention of strangers. Papa said they were all outsiders, that they couldn’t be trusted, that they were dangerous. Papa said that children like Alex were meant to be seen, and never heard. Papa said that garnering too much notice would only lead to trouble.

Then, when he grew up and got AWAY from Papa, he STILL didn’t want to be noticed. He was so much happier, but all the things that had MADE him happier felt dangerous. Everything that had made him happier were things Papa had told him over and over would condemn him to Hell, and that Adam had explained could make some people needlessly angry. “It’s nothing you’re doing wrong,” Adam assured him always. “If anyone’s mean to you, they’re the ones choosing to do it. But, it might happen, and I want you to stay safe, so be careful around anyone you don’t know very well.”

And, Alex HAD been careful. He usually let Adam do all the talking for both of them, because Alex was sure his own voice was too light and obvious. Adam’s was deeper. He dressed in plain, dull colors that wouldn’t catch many people’s eyes. Part of the reason he continued to keep his hair long was so he could hide his face better.

Alex didn’t like being the focus of a stranger’s attention. Attention felt unsafe.

“You’re okay, Alex,” Adam encouraged.

The tailor started to measure Alex’s chest again. Alex tried to remember to breathe. After conditioning himself for so long that anyone accidentally brushing against his chest would inevitably lead to something horrible, it was SO hard to train himself out of those thoughts. He needed something else to focus on until this was over.

That was easy for him to do for a bit. He and Adam were getting married, after all. That had practically been the ONLY thing on Alex’s mind for a while! He wondered if spending time with him would start to feel different afterwards. Some things ALREADY felt different. Alex never had those anxious, nonsensical thoughts that he wasn’t ‘cool’ enough to be with Adam, and that he’d leave as soon as he found someone more exciting. Adam was always going to be there, he was fully committed. Alex’s concerns to the contrary really HAD been silly.

The ceremony was going to be so much fun, too. Adam’s family would be there, and some of Alex’s, too, and Camille. It would be the first really big party Alex had ever attended. They’d exchange their vows, and everyone would celebrate, and then afterwards Alex could use the restroom!

Uh…

Oh.

Before they’d come here to get fitted, they’d had lunch at a small restaurant. Alex had finished two big glasses of lemonade, and he’d been pretty focused on getting THIS done, so he hadn’t even THOUGHT about using the toilet first. Hadn’t even noticed that, actually, he needed to go pretty badly.

There was an acute, sharp pressure right at his opening, and he realized his thighs had been pushing together for quite some time now. Now that he’d actively ACKNOWLEDGED his bladder, it became the only thing he could think about! He wasn’t having an emergency yet, but his urge was deeply uncomfortable. His bladder was constantly throbbing with a tingling tension, and now the requirement that he ‘stay still’ felt more insurmountable than ever.

Was it okay to ask for a break? Alex had already kind of given the tailor a hard time with all his fidgeting. He probably had other appointments to get to. He probably didn’t have TIME for Alex to pee in the middle of this. Alex wouldn’t ask— He didn’t even need to go THAT badly. It was just his inability to squirm that was making it feel so pressing.

Alex didn’t get anxious while his shoulders were being measured, just focused as much as he could on not bouncing. His body REALLY wanted him to move around a bit, like he could somehow shift the contents of his expanding bladder so it wasn’t all resting right at the exit, pushing forcefully into it. All he could do was squeeze his thighs, though.

Was it okay to just tell the tailor to hurry? That would be rude, wouldn’t it? Alex wished he could ask Adam what to do… It would be too embarrassing to blurt out that he had to pee, though. Instead, Alex focused on Adam and tried widening his eyes, an attempt to convey that there was something he needed.

Adam smiled back at him, “You’re doing good, Alex,” he said. “Just stay still.” He was leaning against the wall now, one leg crossed casually over the other. “They should be almost done.”

Alex hoped that was true, his middle was starting to really ache… Except, then the tailor knelt down and was wrapping the tape-measure around Alex’s waist, hands coming really close to his prosthetic. Alex tensed again, accidentally jolting the walls of his bladder and making them buzz with a much more anxious fervor.

Adam had told him before that, if someone ever accidentally touched him there and felt the prosthetic, it would be fine. Unless that person was REALLY feeling him up— In which case, Adam was liable to forget the meaning of pacifism for a moment— then it would feel realistic enough. The prosthetic was just a bit firmer than a cis guy’s penis, so in the worst case scenario it would just feel like Alex was hard.

Alex didn’t want the tailor to think he’d gotten hard, OR that his penis was a prosthetic… He wriggled, anxious that even the slightest knuckle graze would be too much. That small movement made Alex’s urethra stop stinging for a second, bringing a little taste of relief to his bladder, and tempting him to fidget around even MORE, just until his body had calmed down a bit.

“Stay still,” the tailor repeated, stopping Alex’s train of thought.

But, now that he’d BEGUN to squirm, the desire to continue was intense. His bladder fizzed and boiled within him, thighs clenching until he felt them beginning to cramp. ‘Oh, please hurry,’ he thought. ‘It’s starting to get bad!’

Alex did his best not to move around anymore. He knew it would take so much longer if he squirmed and messed up the measurements. But, now the tailor was pulling the tape measure kind of TIGHT around Alex’s midsection, right over his bladder, squishing it just slightly, just enough to make Alex’s opening burn and prompt a needy whine from the back of his throat.

“Hm?” The tailor asked.

“N—Nothing,” Alex said. “Almost done?”

“Nearly,” the man informed him. “Just need your legs.”

Of course, the parts of his body he MOST wanted to start moving were now the ones he needed to keep perfectly still. He nearly asked the man to hurry then, but held it back along with the ripples of pee that were beginning to DEMAND release. The only thing keeping him from panicking at that point was the knowledge that a bathroom was SO close. The second this was finished, he could go. He didn’t need to worry about this becoming too critical.

Adam continued to watch as Alex was measured. He’d stopped flinching, but he still didn’t look comfortable. Adam supposed that was understandable, Alex was shy, this guy was a complete stranger. That was why Adam had to STAY here, even though he felt like he was going to burst, and he could NOT stop looking at the restroom door. He’d begun to fantasize— Actually FANTASIZE— about going through it, unloading his poor bladder into whatever receptacle was closest to the door. If he didn’t just explode and pee all over himself the instant he saw a urinal.

‘Pleeeaaase, hurry uuuup!’ Adam thought, crossing his legs back and forth. ‘Alex— Alex, tell him to hurry! Can’t you see I’m about to soak the floor?’

Alex HAD been glancing over at him with concerned, worried glances. Adam wasn’t sure if that was because he could TELL Adam was dealing with what must have been gallons of piss trying to fit itself into a sixteen ounce container, or just his OWN continued discomfort.

Adam occasionally held himself when the tailor wasn’t looking. Really, he wanted to keep his hands GLUED there, not budging them until he was finally at a toilet. Squeezing his thighs together, he was hit by an intense, sudden spasm. It came on so strongly, and with so little warning, that he felt a dribble of his ocean escape its overflowing prison. “Al—Almost d—“

Before he could finish asking, a woman approached from behind him. When she spoke, it startled him so much that he experienced his SECOND leak of the day. This one lasted a couple seconds, just long enough to feel sort of good. Really, if he weren’t in public, he might have considered just giving up right then and letting the rest out. Just that tiny reprieve was a relief, and he was dying for more.

“Adam Murphy…?” The woman asked.

“Y—Yes,” Adam said.

“I’ll be taking your measurements today,” she told him. “Please, stand over here.”

No. It wasn’t time for his appointment yet, was it? Alex wasn’t even done! Adam checked his watch, confirmed that it WAS time, but… But, he couldn’t! Not now! If he tried to stand still, he’d pop, he’d piss a violent, vicious stream all down his legs, all over that woman’s hands, all over the floor…

He still didn’t want to leave Alex by himself, but it LOOKED like he was almost done, and Adam… Adam couldn’t hold it any longer! “C—Can you wait a minute, I am dying to—“

“No,” the woman interrupted. “I’m sorry, we have a packed schedule today.”

‘Do you WANT me to piss everywhere?’ Adam thought. ‘Because, that’s what’s gonna happen if I’m not at a urinal in two minutes.’ Out loud, he said; “That’s alright…” And went to the woman’s side.

Alex’s tailor had finished with his legs, and was now having him walk back and forth a little bit. Apparently, he needed an idea of how Alex usually moved. This, Alex thought, was actually the trickiest part. He never put any consideration into how he walked, so suddenly THINKING about it made it really awkward. Focusing on a task that was usually automatic made it difficult to know for sure if he even WAS walking the way he typically did.

He was pretty sure that he WASN’T, though. He wasn’t walking how he would normally. He was walking how he would if he was starting to get desperate for the toilet, because he WAS. Since he wasn’t planning to spend his wedding day anxiously waiting for a bathroom break, he didn’t think his current pace was going to be of much use.

His legs kept wanting to rub together, and it took effort not to let them. His steps were small and careful. His bladder throbbed more with each one, and he knew he was leaning strangely in an attempt to soothe it.

Finally, the tailor let him stop walking and said he had everything he needed. Now Alex just had to get what HE needed… “Th—Thank you,” he said, feeling his aching holding muscles ALREADY starting to loosen up. He started for the restroom, but then he heard—

“Adam, you’re going to need to stay still for me here…”

“S—Sorry…”

Alex turned, watching as Adam fidgeted in place while a woman attempted to measure his chest. Was Adam nervous about this, too? Alex had felt way better having Adam there with him, and… Sure, he REALLY needed the toilet soon, but he wasn’t in any danger of an accident if he stuck around a little longer. He was only in danger of… Really, serious discomfort, and that wasn’t so bad.

“It’s okay, Adam,” Alex said.

“R—Right,” Adam nodded, shutting his eyes tightly. He remained still for a moment, but then he shifted his legs again. “Sorry!” His back went straight and he pushed his feet together, hands at his sides, rubbing against his pant-legs, like he always did when he had to pee really bad.

Oh.

Well. Now Alex DEFINITELY couldn’t go! That wouldn’t be fair! Adam was having such a difficult time staying still, obviously HE needed to use the restroom even worse than Alex did. Alex would hold it until Adam was able to pee.

“I—I’m really sorry,” Adam said again. “I’m trying.” Staying still was just… It was impossible. His heart was fluttering with panic, every time he stopped moving, he seriously felt like he was going to just… Pee. Like, there wasn’t a thing he could do to stop it. He felt SO close to a full-on accident that he was getting scared.

In the past, when he’d wet himself, he’d been mostly alright with it. He’d accepted that it HAD to happen. He’d understood that his body could only fit so much liquid into it before it had no choice but to pump it all out so that he didn’t explode into billions of tiny pieces. It was embarrassing, but he didn’t MIND it that much. It wasn’t devastating to have an accident at home, or in the car, or just in front of his friends.

But, here he was, a stranger really close to him, liable to get wet if he spilled over. He was in a pretty upscale clothing store, the sort of place he’d seldom ever been before. The floor beneath him was covered in a fancy, expensive looking plush carpet. The carpet was white and would stain forever if ANYTHING dripped on it.

Having an accident here WOULD be devastating. His and Alex’s wedding budget didn’t include ‘carpet replacements after Adam fails to hold his pee.’

He NEEDED to keep it in, and he just couldn’t figure out how the Hell to DO that without jiggling and crossing his legs and doubling over in complete agony.

He started to bounce again as she measured his shoulders. “Adam…”

“I—I’m sorry,” Adam repeated. “I— Look, I gotta be honest, I need to use the bathroom SO bad. Can we just pause for a minute?”

Alex blushed. He knew Adam wasn’t typically shy about his bladder, but… Alex could NEVER say that to a stranger, especially not in the middle of a fancy store! He WAS grateful that Adam had spoken up though. His own need was becoming more prominent by the second, and he’d started to shift back and forth between his feet— He swore he could HEAR the liquid sloshing inside him.

“Sorry,” the woman said. “Like I told you, our schedule is packed…”

Adam did a few more cringing bounces as he tried to get a handle on his situation. He wanted to argue that she’d probably be finished with him a lot FASTER if he was able to be measured with an empty bladder. He knew he could hold PERFECTLY still if he didn’t have a freaking water-cooler trying to claw its way out of him. “O—Okay, but can you hurry? I’m not kidding, this is an emergency.”

“You need to hold still,” she repeated. “That’s the only way I can rush this.”

Adam gritted his teeth and tensed everything he had, his legs pressed together and squeezed, and he needed to move, he needed to jump up and down and clutch himself and curl over. He needed to become the picture of a person whom was minutes away from drenching themselves with buckets of liquid. He needed to pee, fuck, he needed to pee so bad…

She finished with his shoulders, then moved on to his waist. Adam wondered if she’d even get an accurate measurement there. His bladder may have been so full that it was stretching him out a little. Not enough to really notice, but enough to throw off the measurement. Maybe his pants would end up being a tiny bit loose. ‘Hey, if you end up needing to piss this bad at your wedding, you’ll be thankful…’

He wouldn’t let THAT happen, of course. He’d make sure to pee before it started, the memory of THIS torment would be too fresh in his mind for him to forget. He and Alex had picked a venue, and now Adam wasn’t sure if they’d gotten the right place. He hadn’t even thought to check how many toilets would be there, how easy they were to get to, or anything like that. What if they got there and there was only one, and, like, they had to run through some kind of obstacle course to even use it?

Adam knew he was probably starting to lose it, his brain becoming as waterlogged as the rest of him. He needed something else to think about. Something he couldn’t possibly tie back to peeing. Like—

AHHHH!

The tailor had just SQUEEZED the tape measure around Adam’s middle, basically cutting into his bladder, slicing it WIDE open, and—- Ohhhh, he was gonna pee his pants, he was gonna pee— He doubled over, grabbed himself, and stamped his feet frantically, breathing heavily as he struggled to keep a very persistent leak at bay. If he let go of a drop, it was going to be all over. One drop, and it would feel too good for him to help himself. He’d just give in, let it all come rushing out, consequences be damned.

“Adam,” the tailor said. “Come on, I still need to do your legs.”

“H—Hurry—“ Adam begged, wishing she’d at least show him some kind of sympathy. She should have been thanking him for not gushing all over the carpet yet.

“Stand up a bit straighter,” she prompted.

Adam obeyed, and again he felt like his bladder was being torn open, taut skin stretching out in a way that was just agonizing. ‘Think about something else,’ he begged himself. He tried to think about kissing Alex on their wedding day, but then he imagined being allowed to use the toilet right afterwards.

“I need you to uncross your legs.”

Adam did, painfully. His hands remained wedged between them. They were the only things preventing the inevitable at that point.

Alex watched as Adam struggled so fretfully against his body’s need. Poor thing… Just WATCHING Adam strain and coil and brutally straighten himself out again was making Alex need to go even worse. His own legs had begun to cross back and forth, and he was trying to stop them. It wasn’t fair for him to writhe and squirm and jiggle when Adam was being forced to stay still in the face of such immense pressure.

The tailor was measuring Adam’s legs now, so Alex knew they were almost finished. Adam was staring up at the ceiling now, sweat glistening on his forehead. The corners of his eyes looked glassy, like he was about to cry just from the pain his tormented bladder was flooding him with.

Alex wished there was something he could DO about it. Adam would be finished here in just a couple minutes, but Alex wasn’t even sure if he had a couple SECONDS left to spare before his bladder erupted.

Alex caught himself starting to fidget his legs again and forced them apart from one another. His middle pulsed, the throbs of need were constant now. He was dangerously close to this becoming an emergency, but it was still NOTHING like what Adam was still dealing with.

“Okay, now walk back and forth a few times,” the woman told Adam.

“A—Alright,” Adam said, grateful to finally be granted permission to MOVE. Except, it wasn’t easy to walk. Moving his legs too far apart made him drip, and when those drips didn’t bring him even the barest hint of relief, the desire to let out MORE was strong. He kept bending forwards at the waist, as though scrambling to pick something up off the floor. He also needed to make frequent pauses to squeeze his thighs together and just… Rock back and forth for a couple seconds.   “Try to walk as you usually do,” the woman said.

“If I do that, then I’m going to have an accident,” Adam said. There was no uncertainty in his voice, and he tried to keep any embarrassment he felt out of it as well.

“You need to try,” she told him.

Adam DID try, he managed a few, more ‘casual’ steps, and then he felt a trickle rolling down his leg and—- Ahh, he just wanted to let the rest go, too! He snapped his legs together and crossed them, bouncing. “Th—That’s all I can do, I’m sorry. I really— I wouldn’t say this if I wasn’t serious, I am literally about to wet my pants.”

“… Well, we got all your measurements, at least,” the tailor said finally. “I guess that’s enough.” She picked up a clipboard, which had both Adam and Alex’s information written onto it. “I see you already picked out the suits you wanted, so we don’t need to do that tod—“

“Can I go?” Adam asked, hands flying back between his wriggling thighs. He wanted to ask her if she just had a vendetta against the carpet or something.

She kept reading, “Huh…” She remarked.

“What?!” Adam asked. If she said one of his measurements looked ‘off’ and they needed to try again… There was a decorative vase a few feet away. It could be cleaned a lot easier than the carpet…

“Alex, your waist is narrower than your hips,” she said. “Don’t see that on guys very often, you’re really skinny!”

… Dammit… WHY?

Adam tried to breathe deeply, but his bladder wouldn’t allow him to. He knew the woman hadn’t meant to, but she’d literally zeroed in on Alex’s BIGGEST insecurity. If someone’s goal was to make Alex feel like shit, then THAT was the easiest way to do it by far.

Alex did NOT like his hips. They bothered him immensely. They made him EXTREMELY uncomfortable. And, in HIS eyes, they appeared wider and rounder than they were in reality. He sometimes just FIXATED on them, and the feelings they caused.

Adam hoped this didn’t make him do that again. It hurt him badly to see Alex uncomfortable with himself.

He sure didn’t look comfortable now…

Alex froze, “Uh—Um… I guess I am skinny…” he said. “Adam, I— I have to go to the restroom real bad, too, hurry please?”

Adam didn’t need to be told twice. He… Actually hoped Alex really WAS desperate, and that was why he wanted to rush off. Alex was just dying to pee, and of course he wanted to help Adam make it before HE pissed his pants, that was why he was in such a hurry. It wasn’t because he was upset and hurt and didn’t want to be in public anymore. It wasn’t that.

They made it to the restroom, Alex opened the door, since Adam was still gripping himself with both hands. Adam wanted to say something to Alex, anything to make him forget about what had just happened. His stupid bladder wasn’t allowing him a moment’s pause, however. If he took a second to reassure Alex, he’d explode. He could see the fucking urinals now, he was leaking copiously into his pants, he was completely out of time.

He stumbled up to the closest urinal and opened his already damp pants. He could feel slick, warm wetness as he positioned his prosthetic and finally aimed. He was pretty much already pissing, so his stream just picked up speed slightly when he acknowledged that he was finally in the right spot. It felt… It felt like bliss, honestly. The simple fact that he didn’t have to STRAIN anything anymore was such a massive relief that he felt dizzy. The sensation of his poor bladder deflating was even better.

But, he was too worried about Alex to lose himself too completely to the pleasure of release.

He heard Alex walking behind him, and expected him to come stand beside him. But, instead, Alex headed into a stall. Adam hoped he just wanted some extra privacy to pee in— These urinals didn’t have dividers, and he knew Alex hated that.

He hoped Alex wasn’t just trying to hide…

Alex locked the stall door behind himself. He tried not to think about what the tailor had said. He knew she hadn’t done it to make him feel bad. She had no way of knowing it was a sensitive subject. He just… Didn’t like his hips. They made him feel bad, and… Papa had always… When Alex lived with him, Papa sometimes called them ‘child-bearing hips’, whenever he was talking to Alex about his future.

His future, where he was supposed to… He was supposed to get pregnant as many times as he could, have as many babies as possible. He… He liked the ‘babies’ part, he thought maybe he and Adam would adopt a child someday. But… Any time he imagined himself pregnant… He felt so sick, and scared. He felt a deep, visceral panic all the way down to his bones. It was the most terrifying thing he could think of. Nothing horrified him more. Sometimes, when something happened to remind him his body could DO that, he’d have trouble breathing and his vision would go really dark.

And, Papa never let him forget that his future was going to consist of nothing BUT that. And, when he got older and his body changed and he started to feel so icky all the time, Papa made sure he KNEW what his hips were good for.

Now, he was reminded of all of that all over again, and it made him feel like he needed to squirm out of his own body.

Alex could hear Adam flooding the urinal, and it made him need to go worse. He was right at the toilet, finally. He was sure he’d stop feeling so bad and gross after he used it. If he got rid of ONE of the things currently adding to his discomfort, he’d be okay. He could rid himself of his full bladder a lot easier than he could turn his hips into a shape he found more tolerable.

He unzipped and aimed, his bladder cramping more at the sight of the toilet. His toes curled inside his shoes and he shifted restlessly between his feet. Did everybody notice his hips when they looked at him? Did they think he looked weird because of them?

He tried to ignore those thoughts, particularly when he realized that they were distracting him from peeing. The idea refused to leave him alone, however. He tried to push down on his holding muscles to get his stream started, but it didn’t work. He just kept staring down at himself, his hips appearing wider and more shapely to him than they usually did.

“Nnnh,” Alex whined quietly. He really needed to go… He hated it when his brain got too busy and kept him from peeing! It was always so frightening! He had to empty his bladder so badly, it shouldn’t have taken him any effort to let it go!

But, it WAS taking effort. He was just standing there, straining, unable to get out a drop. He understood his current ‘stage-fright’ situation a little better than he had understood similar experiences in the past; Since something had caused him to feel uncomfortable here, his body didn’t want to accept that this was a safe place to relax and make himself vulnerable while he relieved himself.

Alex did his best to focus on the sound of Adam still peeing away. Poor Adam, no wonder he’d been flailing around so much, he was letting go of a typhoon now, and it was super loud to Alex’s ears. His own bladder flipped within him, desperate to join in. Yet, no matter how strong the pressure against his opening got, nothing would come out.

Frustrated, Alex pushed his pants down the rest of the way and sat on the toilet, deciding to see if he’d have better luck if he changed position. There WAS an immediate change, feeling the cold material of the toilet seat against his skin was an even harsher tease on his bladder than simply looking at the bowl was. Still, he couldn’t convince himself to actually GO.

He just sat there, feeling horridly bloated and full, squirming with desperation even though he was seated on a toilet and wanted nothing more than to start peeing. He squeezed his eyes closed and tried to pretend he was at home, but that didn’t help either.

He heard Adam’s stream finally beginning to slow down, and a heavy sigh falling from his fiancé’s lips. Adam was almost done, and Alex hadn’t even gotten started! Alex pushed harder, wriggling where he sat, begging his bladder to please just empty. But, it wouldn’t. And he was getting REALLY uncomfortable with having his pants down, his hips on full display when he looked down.

Alex listened to the urinal being flushed, and just gave up. Clearly, he wasn’t going to be able to pee here, no matter how much he wanted to. He stood, pulled up his pants and zipped them, trying to ignore the throbs that continued to pulsate beneath his fly. When he opened the stall door and saw Adam, he tried to straighten up.

Adam thought he’d just peed… Alex knew better than to think Adam would be UPSET with him if he admitted he hadn’t, but… Alex had been in that stall for a while, the fact that he hadn’t gotten anything out in all that time was really embarrassing. And, since the issue was simply that a single, innocuous comment had rattled him too badly to unclench, that only added to the shame. He SHOULD have been able to pee, admitting that he was STILL holding on would be humiliating.

Besides, they weren’t that far from their apartment, and if Alex couldn’t pee when he was TRYING to, he doubted he’d be able to have an accident during the drive back. He’d be fine, he’d just have to keep feeling uncomfortable for a bit longer than he’d anticipated.

“Phew…” Adam exhaled. “Seriously almost pissed on the floor. This store ought to give us a discount to thank me for not doing that.”

“F—Feel better?” Alex asked, doing his best not to feel jealous. He really wanted to leave the bathroom now. Since it was useless to him, continuing to stand around inside it was just cruel to his bladder. He bounced on his toes a couple times, before he managed to stop. He had to pretend that he was empty. Maybe if he pretended hard enough, he’d even convince himself, and the heavy pressure weighing him down would lift a little.

“Way better,” Adam said, going to the sinks.

Great… Alex was going to have to deal with this, too. He cringed when he heard one of the faucets turn on, the rush of water forcing him to rub his legs together. He knew he had to wash his hands as well, he was going to have to put his hands underneath that spray, feel it trickling against his skin…

When he put his hands beneath the faucet, there was an abrupt and massive spike in his urgency. His thighs squeezed together and he brought himself up on the tips of his toes, trying to keep his face from twisting in agony. He knew Adam would just ask what was wrong, he knew Adam would only want to help him, but… Alex SHOULDN’T still be holding it! He should have peed, it was embarrassing that he hadn’t! Adam never had problems like that…

He took his hands back out and rubbed them against his pants anxiously. He wanted to go home… He was sure he’d be able to pee as soon as he was there! Adam didn’t need to know that this had happened.

Minutes later, they were in the car and about to head home. Alex struggled against the urge to squirm in his seat. Now that the seat-belt was on, wrapped around his bladder and providing it a painfully tight cradle, it was tricky not to cross his legs.

Adam held his hand for a moment, “Sweet thing, are you okay?” He asked.

Could Adam tell he was still full? Alex blushed, “Um—“

“That thing she said earlier… Lots of guys DO have wider hips, it’s not bad. I like how every part of your body looks.”

Alex blushed more. “I don’t like them… They make me think about… Stuff…”

Adam squeezed his hand tighter for a second before beginning to drive. “Can you tell me what they make you think about?”

Alex’s bladder lurched with an awful spasm when the car started to move. His ankles rubbed together the instant they went over a speed-bump, liquid sloshing painfully. “Papa used to remind me how my hips are for giving birth, and that was good since I’m supposed to have lots of babies. And… I mean, I LIKE babies, I hope we can adopt one whenever we’re ready for it, but… When I think about being… pregnant, I feel… It scares me really bad…”

Adam reached to rub Alex’s hand again, feeling that it was pretty clammy. “Okay, first I want you to know that your Dad should NEVER had said those things, and it’s normal that listening to that made you uncomfortable. Like, even if you actually WERE a girl, your Dad shouldn’t talk about your body that way and tell you what to do with it. Did he do that to your sisters?”

“Yeah,” Alex nodded, shifting in his seat slightly. He couldn’t find any position that kept the seat-belt away from his throbbing abdomen. “Patience was close to my age, so she got it a lot. Sometimes the little ones did too.”

“Gotta be honest, that’s kinda creepy,” Adam said. “You’re right to feel uncomfortable about it. And it’s also okay that the idea of pregnancy scares you. But, try not to worry TOO much about it. You’ve been on T for a long time, so it’s unlikely to happen— And, I mean, it’s IMPOSSIBLE for it to happen with me no matter WHAT we do together, so—“

“I— I know, it’s irrational,” Alex said. The car went over another bump, and Alex jostled his knee up and down for several seconds. The only reason he stopped was because he was worried he was making it too obvious. “But, I get so scared every time I think about it.”

“That’s alright,” Adam said. “Sounds like this might be a phobia you have— I think I’ve read that phobias can make you think a little less rationally. I’m sorry that looking at part of your body makes you think about scary things. But… That’s not what your hips are FOR, they’re yours, so they’re for whatever YOU want to do with them.”

Alex shuffled his feet. “Okay…” he said.

He still didn’t sound that comfortable, so Adam added; “How about… I could teach you to dance? Maybe that can help change what you think about when you look at your hips? I dunno…” It at least SOUNDED plausible in his head. If Alex was able to associate that area of his body with something else, he SHOULD be able to feel a little better about it.

Alex shrugged. He hadn’t been allowed to dance when he lived with Papa. And he was pointedly trying NOT to dance right now… “I guess that could be fun.”

“Okay, awesome,” Adam smiled. “We’re gonna dance at our wedding anyways, right?”

“Y—Yeah!” Alex said, smiling more now. He glanced out the window, dismayed to see that they still had a bit longer to go before they reached home. He was fidgeting more in his seat now, insides throbbing with the need to release some pressure. Oh, he wished he’d been able to pee while he’d been in that stall! He wished he’d at least managed to get some of it out…

His need was creeping upwards in intensity at an alarming pace. The seatbelt was constricting his bladder to such a degree that he felt like his middle was being cut into. He was trying his best to stay still, gripping the sides of his seat so that his hands didn’t go to his crotch, tensing his legs so they wouldn’t bounce… But, he kept needing to adjust his position, searching for one that didn’t make him feel like he was going to explode.

Adam noticed all of Alex’s restless movement. He thought it looked like he needed to take a leak, but he’d JUST gone a few minutes ago, hadn’t he? It must have been something else… “You’re gonna look really good in your suit,” Adam told him, hoping that would assuage any of Alex’s lingering unease. “I might have some trouble keeping my hands off you during the ceremony…”

“Heh…” Alex cracked a smile, but he was far too distracted by his bladder to do much more. “You’ll look good too,” he said, continuing to stare out the window, trying to count the number of turns left to make before they’d finally be home and he’d at last be able to unload his bladder. They’d be on the highway soon, and then it wouldn’t be much further. Ten more minutes, at most. Alex could handle ten more minutes of this, even if he had to ignore all his urges to begin squirming.

They turned onto the highway, and were immediately met with miles of frozen traffic. Alex’s bladder cramped painfully at the sight, and the realization that he was likely an HOUR away from home, from the relief he needed so much… “Nnnh…” Alex mewled softly without intending to, tapping a foot sharply.

Adam turned, “Hm?” He asked. “What’s the matter, sweet thing?”

Alex shook his head, “N—Nothing…” he said softly. Adam thought he’d JUST peed, it hadn’t been long enough for him to need it again yet! He, again, tried to pretend to himself that he really HAD used the toilet before getting in the car. He hadn’t gotten any stage-fright, everything had poured out exactly like it was supposed to. So, that meant his bladder was still mostly empty. He didn’t need to pee hardly at all.

All the pretending in the world could not erase what was true, though. He was desperate to go, so desperate that his throat was constricting and panicked sweat was trickling down his neck. Trapped in the car, not moving at all, with nowhere to let it out, was making his heart pound. He shook a little from head to toe, and tucked his hands beneath his thighs, rocking side to side in his seat.

Adam noticed Alex fidgeting, heard his breathing start to accelerate. “Are you sure you’re alri—“

“When will we get home?!” Alex blurted. “I want— I wanna be at home soon…”

Adam looked him over. He was SERIOUSLY acting like he needed to go to the bathroom, but that couldn’t have been it. At most, it had been thirty minutes since Alex had last used the toilet. He hadn’t been drinking any more copiously than usual today. It must have been something else causing him distress. He was still upset after earlier…

Adam took his hand and squeezed it. “I’m sorry, with the roads all backed up it might be about an hour.”

“An hour?” Alex whimpered. He’d assumed as much, but it was horrifying to hear that be confirmed. He couldn’t— He could NOT wait for another hour! He’d already waited long enough!

“Is that okay?” Adam asked. “I’m really sorry, there isn’t another way home. Just hold my hand, try to feel better.”

Alex gripped Adam’s hand tighter, searching for the emotional relief the action usually brought him. Nothing could make Alex feel relieved now, though. Not even clinging to Adam.

“It’s okay…” Adam said gently. “We’ll be home soon, and I’ll just hold you for a while until you feel—“

“I—“ Alex interrupted, a sharp pang stabbing his opening just before a tiny spurt of warmth spilled out between his thighs. He tensed up and stamped his feet. He couldn’t do this anymore, he had to at least be free to squirm, or else he was going to have an accident all over his seat. “Adam, I… I really, really have to go…”

Adam stroked Alex’s hand tenderly. Even after hearing those words, he had a difficult time believing Alex could actually be desperate again already. “Go where?”

“T—To the bathroom,” Alex said, his bladder thrashing at the admission and forcing him to cross his legs. The hand not clasping Adam’s went between his legs and he rocked himself against it. “Adam, I— I need the bathroom now…”

Adam squeezed his hand harder. “I—It’s okay,” he said. “Just one hour. You can—“

“I can’t!” Alex interrupted. “I can’t wait another hour, I— I’ve been waiting too long!”

Adam, again, tried to calm him down. “It’s okay,” he repeated. “It hasn’t been that long. You went before we—“

“I didn’t!” Alex moaned, shuffling his feet against the floor, his bladder throbbing with nonstop pulses, each one feeling more and more like it was going to end in a leak. “I couldn’t go then, and I already had to go bad, and now I can’t wait. I’m gonna wet myself!”

Panic gripped Adam too then. “You didn’t go earlier?”

Alex shook his head, feeling another burst of liquid warming up his boxers. It was coming out… He had to fight even harder to restrain this leak, doubling forwards and clutching himself tightly. “I couldn’t! I tried, and it just wouldn’t come out. I thought I could make it home, but I can’t!”

“… Oh,” Adam said guiltily. He’d… He’d been so focused on emptying his own bladder, that he hadn’t paid much attention to what Alex was doing in the stall. He hadn’t noticed that no trickling sounds had ever emerged from within it. He’d just assumed Alex had emptied. “I’m sorry, I didn’t realize—“

“N—Not your fault,” Alex said. “I’m the one that couldn’t go…”

“And that’s not YOUR fault,” Adam said. “That just happens sometimes, it’s oka—“

“I—It’s not,” Alex insisted tearfully, bouncing up and down. All the jiggling was just sloshing his bladder and irritating its sensitive walls even more, but he couldn’t stop moving around now that he’d started. “I’m gonna pee myself…”

“Y—You won’t!” Adam tried to reassure him, but it really DID look like Alex was on the verge of doing exactly that. It made Adam’s heart clench to watch him in so much discomfort. When he spotted tears forming in the corners of Alex’s eyes, Adam panicked and tried to think of a solution. Alex would start to sob for real if he had an accident… Adam couldn’t stand seeing him cry.

They were just barely crawling down the road, and Adam couldn’t spot any exits close to their current position. No sign indicating a gas station that could save Alex just in time. He moved to open the glove box. It was tricky for either one of them to fill a bottle while sitting down, but he’d helped Alex do it before, they could do that again.

But, there weren’t any bottles, and Adam knew EXACTLY what Alex would say if he suggested he just climb out of the car and release his flood on the side of the road. Alex would never be able to do that in broad daylight, everyone being able to watch him from their cars. He’d probably be so scared about getting in trouble for it that he wouldn’t even be ABLE to pee, no matter how close to exploding his bladder he may have been.

Adam remembered a story his Dad had told him once. He’d gotten desperate during a huge traffic jam before too, and eventually he’d gotten out of the car and opened the hood, pretending to look for a problem while really just using it as a shield to discreetly relieve himself onto the pavement.

Would Alex be okay with THAT? No one would be able to tell what he was doing if he stood really close to the front of the car… “Sweet thing, um… I don’t think the traffic will get better for a while, and… There aren’t any bottles, and—“

“I can’t wait,” Alex moaned, contorting in all directions. “I’m gonna wet the seat— Please don’t be mad at me!”

“Shhh, it’s okay,” Adam told him. “I won’t be mad at you, but you aren’t gonna wet the seat, I promise.”

“But— But there’s nowhere else to go— I— I feel sick, Adam,” Alex said. “It really hurts.” His face had gone very pale, his cheeks and forehead dampening with sweat.

“Just… Get out of the car, go to the front and lift up the hood. Act like there’s something wrong with the car, and then you’ll have enough cover to—“

“S—Someone will notice!” Alex protested, shifting his legs restlessly. “I don’t want to get in trouble!”

“You won’t, it will be okay,” Adam reassured. “I promise.”

Alex shook his head, and he looked so frightened that Adam dropped the subject.

“Just— If you have to, that’s an option,” Adam said. “Hopefully we’ll see a gas station soon.”

Alex nodded, moving constantly where he sat. His hair was starting to go slick from his copious sweating. He looked so pained that Adam WANTED to keep pushing him to just get out and piss in front of the car.

Alex was too terrified of being caught and punished for it, though. There was a chance he’d freeze up again, and STILL not manage to drain his bladder.

Adam kept glancing around the car— There had to be SOMETHING useful. If not a bottle, then… Something, anything! He wanted to get Alex some relief as badly as Alex himself wanted it! Finally, he turned around in his seat and spotted a few towels left in the back from when they’d visited a pool with Camille.

There were four towels, if they were layered, they’d hold a lot, especially if Alex didn’t let it all out in the same spot. Adam reached and grabbed them, tugging them to the front. “O—Okay, how about… Uh, just… stand up for a second and pull down your pants.”

Alex looked up from the huddled, trembling ball of desperate knots he’d tied himself into. “H—Huh?”

“Move your pants out of the way, and then you can sit on these towels, so if you… If you can’t make it, you won’t wet your clothes or stain the seat or anything.”

“But, the towels—“

“We can wash them, it will be fine,” Adam said. “It’s okay. I’d rather have stained towels than see you in pain.”

“O—Okay,” Alex said. He hurried to unbuckle his seatbelt, and after a few moments of fumbling with his shaking hands, managed to unlatch it. The sudden release of the belt from around his aching bladder felt really good, but the loss of pressure reminded him so much of the feeling of actually PEEING that it made him moan.

He pushed his clothing down around his ankles as Adam spread the towels out on his seat, one atop the other. When Alex lowered himself onto them, naked from the waist down, he squirmed with discomfort. It felt weird to be so exposed in the car, even if he knew no one but Adam could see.

“There…” Adam said. “Now, if you start to pee, pay attention to how wet the towels are getting, move them a bit if you think they’re too soaked. But, with four of them, I think they should be able to hold everything.”

“Wh—What if they can’t?”

“Then we can clean whatever makes it to the seat,” Adam said. “It will be fine. You can keep trying to wait, but it’s okay if you use the towels.”

Alex felt better already upon hearing that. A lot of the panic left him. Just, the knowledge that he didn’t NEED to hold it all in until he got home was a relief. For several minutes, he felt so much more secure that it was actually EASIER to hold his bladder in. He was even able to put his seatbelt back in place with only minimal discomfort.

Then, they finally started moving again! Alex sighed, feeling hopeful. There should be a gas station soon, he’d get to relieve his bladder PROPERLY into an actual toilet. It really WOULD be okay.

Only, then the car in front of them came to a sudden stop and Adam had to slam on the brakes. Alex was jolted hard, his seatbelt pulling him backwards and squeezing so firmly into his bladder that a hard gush of pee hissed out from between his legs, wetting the towels and— Ohhh, it felt so good… He actually LET it continue for a few seconds before remembering what he was doing, squirming his thighs together in an attempt to stop it. He managed to slow it down, but it continued to trickle slowly.

Adam took his hand again, having heard the hiss of his loss of control. “It’s okay… Shhh… Just let it all go…” He rubbed Adam’s thumb slightly, encouraging. “Pretend you’re on the toilet…”

Alex shut his eyes and tried to do that. He wasn’t in the car, he was in the restroom. He was sitting on the toilet, because it was the middle of the night and he was sleepy and bursting. He’d woken up from a dream filled with watery imagery, and he had to go so bad that he’d barely sat down in time.

His spray resumed, leaking out into the material of the towels underneath him. He could feel the warmth spreading out in between his thighs and around his butt, and it wasn’t the most pleasant sensation, but his bladder finally squeezing itself dry felt so amazingly wonderful that it didn’t bother him too much. “Haaahhhh…” he exhaled, starting to shudder, a smile forming on his face.

“There you go…” Adam said. “That’s better… Just let it happen…”

Alex did, completely forgetting where he was. All he could comprehend was the immense relief and satisfaction of finally giving his body what it so desperately needed. It pumped out of him in a strong, pressurized rush, the towels beneath him rapidly saturating. He forgot that he was supposed to watch out for that until Adam reminded him.

“That part’s pretty wet now, move over a little…”

Alex reached and adjusted the towels, starting to flood a dryer spot now. “Ahhhh…” he moaned, shaking harder.

“Feel good now?” Adam asked.

“Yeah…”

“Good…” Adam said, continuing to rub Alex’s hand until he was completely empty, just sitting there blearily as the final drips seeped from him.

Alex made no move to get back up or remove the towels, still adjusting to how it felt not to be exploding.

“All finished?” Adam said.

“Yes,” Alex nodded. Finally, he stood up and pulled his pants back on. He carefully rolled the towels back up, and was even more relieved when he saw nothing had made it onto the seat. “Where do I put the—“

“Just, on the floor is fine,” Adam said.

Alex left the towels by his feet and sat back down. “Phew…”

“Everything okay now?”

Alex nodded again. “Thank you…”

“You’re welcome,” Adam told him. “And… Next time you’re having trouble peeing, it’s alright to tell me, you know? It’s fine to get stage-fright every now and then, it happens.”

“You haven’t ever had that problem,” Alex said. “Only me.”

“That’s not true,” Adam shook his head. “I’ve had it happen before too. The first time I used a urinal? I had a LOT of trouble. All the stalls were taken, I was bursting, and I hadn’t gotten good at using my STP through a zipper yet. I couldn’t go at all, but I couldn’t hold it anymore either. I told my Dad and he taught me this way I can breathe to calm myself down, and that worked when I tried to go again. If you tell me when you’re having trouble, I can help you.”

“O—Okay,” Alex said. “Next time…”

“Good.”
