Like the last few stories I've posted, this was originally written using characters from a non-kink book I've written. So, name-changes were made and the setting was kept vague to keep it from being recognizable, I hope the vagueness does not distract from the desperation content. The characters featured here were previously seen in this story

. The video game urinals mentioned here are actually real things.

I've never been a super big fan of the 'guys can pee, but girls can't' tropes in omo stories. So here I wanted to try something where the girl in question can pee, and can even do it just like a guy. But, is simply making herself hold it due to being too prideful to admit she wants someone to keep watch for her. So, her issue is purely stubbornness and not so much a physical limitation.

***

Shelby was going to be first in line when the store opened in the morning. She’d be the first to get her hands on the limited edition figurine that could only be obtained by pre-ordering the new Last Reverie game from this specific chain of stores. She’d set up a tent outside the store, and already more people were joining her and doing the same.

It had been murder trying to convince her parents to let her do this. Dad wasn’t too keen on the idea of her spending all night in a parking lot, and had insisted she could only go if her brother Emmett accompanied her. Shelby had been tempted to say that was a load of sexist nonsense; She and Emmett were twins, so it wasn’t like he was any more of an adult than she was. And, when push came to shove, she was more likely to be able to defend herself than Emmett was. Not only had she always just seen herself as being tougher than her fragile, nervous brother, but she’d been the one to take multiple self-defense classes and carried pepper spray everywhere.

But, she really wanted to go to this, and it wasn’t like she really minded spending time with her brother. Emmett, however, did mind having to stay up so late, and then try to get some rest in a sleeping bag that offered little cushion from the pavement. He also really minded the fact that he could not shower or brush his teeth before going to bed. He felt dirty all over, all his sweat from the day still caked on his body, and his teeth uncleaned; Plaque was basically bacteria poop, and the knowledge that he couldn’t rinse that crud off was making him profoundly uncomfortable.

He was just glad he’d at least remembered his hand sanitizer. He was even more glad when he realized that, after the stores closed, he wouldn’t be able to use a proper restroom with a sink in it to wash his hands afterwards. No, instead it seemed everyone had decided to pee into bottles. It had repulsed him to no end, but eventually the pressure in his bladder had outweighed his disgust and he’d given in and made use of a bottle. Then emptied at least a quarter of his hand sanitizer into his palms.

Shelby kind of groaned as he did these things. He thought maybe she was about to tease him for being such a germaphobe again. Or that she didn’t like being in earshot of her brother peeing in a bottle. Or maybe she’d filled one of his bottles of hand-sanitizer with super-glue again and was disappointed that he’d grabbed the one that she hadn’t sabotaged. He stood up to throw out the bottle somewhere.

Shelby groaned again, quieter now. Really, she was groaning because the sound of Emmett peeing in the bottle had made her own bladder spasm with need. She’d been so excited to get here and be first in line that she hadn’t peed before leaving the house, and had been drinking a lot of soda all day since she knew she’d need the caffeine. All of it wanted out now.

But, she didn’t think she could pee in one of the bottles, all the openings were too small to be usable for her. She was pretty sure, anyway. The thing was, Shelby was more adept at controlling her stream than most girls were. She could even pee standing up like a guy so long as she pulled her pants down low enough.

She’d taught herself this new skill a couple years ago. On an Internet forum, she had been made aware of the existence of a particular kind of urinal that was built with a sensor that kept track of the position and strength of the user’s stream, and came equipped with LCD screens mounted above them that housed a video game. Instead of a controller, the game was operated with the user’s pee stream. On the forum, some jackass was using the existence of these things to ‘prove’ that women did not belong in gaming.

Shelby told him that that was complete nonsense, along with a few more colorful phrases. They’d fired back and forth at each other so much that the topic ended up getting locked by the board’s moderators. Still, Shelby kept thinking about the urinal video games, and how unfair it was that anyone would develop a game that half of the population physically could not play.

But then she thought that maybe she was wrong. She’d been told all her life that she was not supposed to pee standing up, but she’d never actually tried it. Maybe she could do it, and she just didn’t know because she hadn’t tried; It had just been too ingrained into her that it was impossible.

She was not brazen enough to just try and do it on a whim, so she did some research first. She found that people with female parts could, in fact, pee standing up; There were devices that could be purchased to do it, and even a method to do it without any such device. She found online stores to purchase the devices, but then imagined Emmett or her parents opening the package it was in before she did. That would be awkward. So, instead she was going to try and do it without a device. That, she thought, would also prove the asshole on that forum even more wrong.

She practiced in the shower for a long time, until she could reliably hit the drain every single time. She kind of had to lean funny, and force her pee out really, really hard, but it worked. Then, she started doing it at the toilet at home with all of her clothing off. Once she got the hang of that, she did it with her clothes on. There were a couple mishaps before she figured out how far her pants needed to be lowered, but after that it was easy. She rarely sat down to pee anymore, which was super useful in public bathrooms. She swore, it was like people who ‘hovered’ were just trying to make a mess, and it was nice not to have to sit in it.

She’d kept her new talent a secret for a while. But, it made her feel such a weird sense of pride that she wanted to show it off. Just… That wasn’t really the most socially acceptable thing to do. She imagined meeting that jackass from the forum in real life someday, conveniently just outside a men’s room that housed those video game urinals. She’d challenge him to a game and proceed to thoroughly wipe the floor with his chauvinistic ass.

But, that was unlikely to ever happen. Still, she wanted to show off to somebody; She was doing something that most people thought was impossible and it made her feel strangely powerful. She finally got the chance to display her skill to someone when on a trip with her family. They’d made several stops at gas stations, where her germaphobic, clean-freak of a brother refused to pee, even as he got visibly more and more desperate. She’d watched as he constantly twisted around in his seat, staring desperately out the window while palming his crotch. She pointed out to him he was being silly, and so did their parents, but still he said he’d hold it until they were somewhere ‘clean’.

Partway through the trip he was basically out of his seat and gripping himself for all he was worth. Dad even offered to just pull over and let him pee on the side of the road, but since Emmett didn’t have his hand sanitizer to clean up with afterwards, that wasn’t good enough either. Shelby thought he was being a complete moron, but if he wanted to just pee all over himself and the car, that was his prerogative.

But, he didn’t pee himself. They got to the hotel and he was still miraculously dry. While Dad got them checked into their room, Emmett ran, half-hunched over, for the men’s room in the lobby. Seeing him fidget and squirm for the past three hours had made Shelby feel a bit of an urge to go as well, and as she watched him hobble desperately for the restroom, she’d realized her own bladder was pretty full.

They’d gotten to the hotel fairly late in the night. The lobby was totally deserted save for them and the employees. She walked the same direction Emmett had and pushed open the door to the men’s room. Emmett was at one of the urinals, and Shelby could hear him peeing so hard she thought his stream could probably strip paint off a wall. The moan of relief he’d been making cut off as soon as he saw her; “What are y—“

Shelby did not give him a chance to finish, “Check this out!” she said. She proceeded to take the urinal right beside his, pull her pants down to around her knees, lean back, position her hands, and release. Her pee sprayed into the urinal, not a drop going down her legs instead.

“What the Hell!?” Emmett’s face went red. This was not the kind of thing a person saw everyday. He didn’t really want to see it, honestly. She was his freaking sister and now she was partially naked right beside him. That was okay when they were younger, sure, but not now. If his bladder wasn’t so worn out and sore after hours of desperation, he would have tried to cut off his flow and just leave. But, he couldn’t stop peeing; his bladder had been so utterly full that it was determined to keep draining until there was nothing left inside it. So, he was trapped there.

“Cool, right?” Shelby asked.

“No! How are you even doing that?!”

“It’s really easy, I kinda make a peace sign with my fingers, and then put them—“

“N-Never mind! I don’t want to know!” Emmett interrupted. He tried not to pay attention to what Shelby was doing, just focus on how good it felt to finally pee after holding it all day on bumpy roads. He blocked her out eventually, once she’d stopped talking.

Even though Emmett had started peeing before she’d even entered the room, by the time Shelby was finished he was still going strong. She pulled up her pants. “What do you think of my mad skills?”

“I think you need to stop talking to me,” Emmett said. “At least wait for me to finish first.” After his bladder was empty and took some of his discomfort away with it, he told Shelby that he supposed that was a little impressive. Just, in a really gross, bizarre way. “Also, if you want to use urinals, don’t take the one right next to someone else, okay?”

“Why not?”

“It’s just a thing. You shouldn’t do it.”

“So, like, if somebody comes in about to have an accident, and the only available urinal is right next to somebody else they just have to hold it?”

“Yes.”

“That’s stupid,” Shelby said. “What if that had been the case when you came in here earlier? You would have just wet yourself with a toilet right there?”

“It’s just a thing,” Emmett repeated. “Okay?”

Now, sitting in the parking lot of the game store, Shelby tried not to think of those memories. That time in the hotel, it had felt really good to let go of her bladder and pee. Just like she knew it would feel extremely amazing to do right now. But, even if she could pee standing up, even if she could use a urinal without making a mess of herself, the tiny opening of the bottle would be impossible.

Now, of course, that was not the only option she had. She’d seen some of the guys in line behind her pee against the wall in between two stores. She could do that, it was a much larger target to hit after all. But, she’d still have to take her pants down to at least her knees. She may not have minded doing that in front of her brother, but… Well, he was her brother. Her twin brother. They’d seen each other naked lots of times growing up, so it just felt different to her, like it just wasn’t a very big deal.

A bunch of strange men she didn’t even know, on the other hand? That was a different story. Even if she went further down the alleyway, she’d still feel like they were looking at her and could see everything. And… Maybe they’d be too stunned by the sight of a girl peeing standing up to pay attention to anything else, but her butt would still be visible and she didn’t want any of them getting a peek at it.

She could ask Emmett to come with her and keep watch. Stand right behind her and block the view of any potential voyeurs. Except, she’d wanted to prove to herself that she didn’t need an ‘escort’. She didn’t need to rely on her brother like her Dad had assumed. She could handle herself fine. She didn’t want to admit that she needed help with anything.

So, she decided to wait until people started going to sleep. Once that happened, she’d go down the alleyway and relieve herself. Simple. What wasn’t so simple was not making it obvious that she had to go. Her legs had been crossed over each other as she sat for the last half hour, and now she’d begun sitting on top of her foot to keep her urine where it belonged. She hoped no one noticed how much she was squirming.

Emmett returned from throwing out the bottle he’d used as an emergency toilet and gave a yawn. “Well, I’m going to try and sleep now,” he said.

“Oh, yeah, me too,” Shelby said. She knew that once she was in her sleeping bag, she’d have more privacy to writhe. The two crawled into their tent and Emmett quickly settled inside his sleeping bag. But, he shifted uncomfortably.

“Ugh… This material is way too thin,” Emmett said. “I swear I can feel every crack in the pavement under me.”

Shelby didn’t say anything, she started to get into her own sleeping bag. When she laid down on her back, her bladder suddenly felt even fuller. She could practically feel the tender skin of her abdomen stretching overtop of it. She turned onto her side and swore she could hear the liquid inside her slosh with the motion. The horrid pressure was still there. She tried to flip onto her stomach—

“Ahh!” She yelped. That had been a terrible idea! The worst idea ever in the history of bad ideas! Rolling onto her front had practically put all of her body weight onto her bladder, it had been enough to make her lose a few drops.

“Yeah, not too comfortable, is it?” Emmett asked.

Shelby turned back onto her side, deciding that was the most manageable position. Her hands, concealed by the sleeping bag, went right between her legs and she pressed herself into her palms as she tried to get a handle on things again. “Nnnh,” she breathed. “No. It’s not.”

“Are you okay?” Emmett asked. “You sound hurt. There’s not… Like, a nail underneath you or something, is there?”

Shelby almost said it then. She almost said “I just need to pee really bad. Please come with me and keep watch.” But, she couldn’t. She could take care of herself. So, instead she said “Just… Got a cramp in my leg.”

“Need some water?” Emmett asked. “That helps.”

“No!” Shelby answered, perhaps a bit too quickly. “It’s fine. It’s fine. It went away.”

“Well, okay, if you’re sure,” Emmett said. He laid back down and turned away from her.

Shelby was grateful he had, now she felt like she had even more privacy. Her hands remained tucked between her legs and she clenched her thighs around them. Her ankles rubbed together. She just laid there and waited, listening to the sounds of other people outside the tent. Slowly, way too slowly, the number of voices dropped down lower and lower. People were going to sleep finally.

Every few minutes, Shelby’s bladder would spasm, the walls squeezing in on themselves as they fought to push out everything she had stored inside her. Sometimes, one of these spasms would result in a leak. She could feel her pants growing a little damp underneath her pressed palms.

Eventually, silence fell outside. Shelby tried to wait a few extra minutes, just to be sure. Those extra minutes were the worst of all. Her bladder was so certain she was the only one awake now, confused why that hadn’t resulted in relief yet. When she was finally positive no one was up to see her, she started to get up. Getting onto her knees was torturous, but that had nothing on the pain produced by crawling from the tent. She had to keep one of her hands against herself as she moved and her legs just refused to untangle from each other, so she was more just dragging herself along. Outside the tent, she was unable to fully stand up. She managed it for a split second, but then doubled over on herself as the longest spurt yet trickled down her legs.

She limped to the alleyway, certain she looked just like her brother had that night at the hotel. She was now beginning to think that, maybe she’d been acting just as silly as he had that day. There should have been no shame in asking him to keep watch for her. It was understandable she wouldn’t want to pull down her pants where a stranger could see.

Oh well, it was over now. She was gonna pee in just a few seconds.

Once she was in the alley though, her skin started to prickle. It was really dark here… And really, really quiet. She couldn’t even hear a cricket chirping or anything. The emptiness was creeping her out. She tried to ignore that as she lowered her pants and adopted the position she’d learned was the easiest to stand to pee in, prepared for mind-bending amounts of relief.

But, nothing happened.

That was weird, and it kind of freaked her out. Every other time in her life that she’d told her body it was time to pee, it had been instant; she’d just peed. She’d never had to try to go, especially not when she was as desperate as she was in that moment. But, this time, it felt like something was in the way, like something just refused to loosen.

She groaned and pulled her pants down the rest of the way. She lowered herself into a squat, thinking that might work better. It didn’t. Nothing came out. She pressed a hand against her lower stomach, and that made her yelp in pain again. But, no stream. Had she held it for so long that she’d broken something? That idea scared her, but not as much as dark, eerie silence of the alleyway.

Maybe that was it. Since she felt so scared, she was too tense to even pee. But, what could she do about it?

She knew exactly what she could do about it. The trouble was just that she didn’t want to. She knew Emmett would be very irritated about being woken up, and she still didn’t want to admit she needed help, but she saw no other options. She would burst soon if she didn’t get her bladder to empty somehow. Hobbling back to the tent and crawling back inside made her spurt several more times. That annoyed her; Why was her bladder willing to release now when she was trying to hold it, but refused to ease when she’d wanted to let go?

She nudged Emmett, feeling a touch guilty. She knew it must have taken him a while to get to sleep since he was so uncomfortable. He wasn’t going to like being woken up again. He grimaced as he woke and did not open his eyes. “What?” he mumbled.

“I need to pee,” Shelby said.

“Then pee,” Emmett said.

“I need you,” Shelby admitted quietly. “I need you to keep watch for me, okay?”

“What are you talking about…” Emmett asked. He opened his eyes and seemed to remember where they were. “Oh, right…” He rubbed his tired eyes. “Why didn’t you go before we went to bed?”

Shelby’s wrists were pressing between her thighs now as she writhed; “I don’t know…” she whimpered out. “Pride, I guess.”

“Pride?" Emmett repeated, not understanding.

“I didn’t want to ask you to keep watch,” Shelby said.

“That’s just silly.”

“I know, okay? I realized that when I saw how dark and creepy the alley is at night. Can you just help me?”

“Okay, okay,” Emmett said. “I kinda have to go too, anyway.”

The two exited the tent, Shelby making tiny, little distressed sounds as she crawled. The small sounds transformed into loud gasps and groans when she struggled to stand, hands clutching herself tight. Emmett was watching her display and shaking his head. He would have gladly kept watch for her sooner if she’d just said something about it. He didn’t understand why she was so averse to asking for help all the time. Everyone needed help sometimes, and one of the nice things about having a twin was supposed to be that you always had someone around to ask.

They reached the alleyway again. “Are you gonna do that weird thing again?” Emmett asked. He didn’t know why. Of course she was going to pee standing up again. Given the choice between squatting to pee and just doing it standing, Emmett figured everyone would choose to stand if they knew how. He’d never squatted to pee outside, he’d never had a reason to, but he was pretty sure the position wasn’t very comfortable to stay in for very long, and made it more likely for the person to pee on their own feet or something.

Sure enough, Shelby quickly began hosing down the wall just like a guy would. “Ahhhhh…” she breathed. Relief overtook her as her stream spattered the concrete in front of her. She couldn’t believe she’d managed to make it, the loosening of her pelvic muscles felt like a hard-won reward. The shift of the massive, painful weight in her core transformed agony into unrestrained pleasure. “This feels so good…”

“Please don’t talk to me while you do that,” Emmett said.

“But, Emmett, it feels so good…”

“And definitely don’t say my name.” Emmett was trying very hard not to pay attention, partially because the fact his sister peed like a boy honestly just weirded him out, and partially because the sound was making him more aware of how much he needed to empty his own bladder. It was hard to block it out, though. Shelby’s stream was so forceful, it sounded like a watery explosion. It didn’t sound like a mere stream at all, just furious, intense hissing. And it kept going on and on and on. He didn’t know how anyone could pee that hard, especially for so long.

The sound of it was taunting his bladder so much and he began to jiggle up and down as he wished she’d hurry up and finish soon so he could go. She noticed his bouncing and told him he could pee now if he wanted. He wanted to argue that it would be hard to keep watch and handle his need at the same time, but his bladder was fed up with waiting and listening to Shelby soak the wall with what must have been gallons of hissing pee.

He stood next to her and unzipped, his own stream beginning less than a second later. “Phew…” he sighed.

“Swordfight!” Shelby declared, and she directed her stream against her brother’s.

Emmett jumped a little, but couldn’t stop peeing. “Ack, stop! That’s gross!”

“It’s not. Urine’s sterile,” Shelby said. “I think… I read it somewhere, but I might be wro—“

“Either way, it’s still weird,” Emmett said.

“Why’s it weird for me to pee standing up, but it’s not weird for you to do it?”

“Because…” Emmett groped for words, but couldn’t think of anything. “I don’t know… I guess it’s just because it’s… unusual for a girl to do that.”

“It’s fun,” Shelby said. “Don’t you think so?”

“I’ve never really thought about it, but I guess?”

Shelby finally finished up and Emmett did so as well a few seconds after.

“Do you still need to… y’know, wipe afterwards?”

“Not usually,” Shelby said, pulling her pants back up. “I think since I have to pee so hard, I don’t notice as much left on me afterwards.”

“You ever have that thing happen where you think you’re done, and then a few more drops come out once you get to the sink?” Emmett asked. “I’ve always hated that, it feels so gross. I only hear guys mention it, so I figure it has to do with going standing up.”

“I’ve never had that,” Shelby shrugged. “Thanks for coming with me, by the way. Next time you’re gonna have to actually swordfight with me, though.”

“Who said there was gonna be a ‘next time’?!”

I absolutely, no exaggeration, LOATHE AND DESPISE that trope. I feel so awful for these women having to endure so much pain while guys get to enjoy the delights of their patriarchal benefits. I like the whole "she can pee but she chooses not to because of stubbornness and embarrassment" better because it's more of an individual issue that can just as easily happen to anyone. Hell I used to be absolutely MORTIFIED at the idea of having to pee anywhere but a toilet, but now I don't mind it and actually kinda prefer the thrill and freedom of peeing in the woods. But god does denying an entire gender the right to pee whenever they want make my blood boil red with rage. Unfortunately there are plenty of stories about that premise/trope on this site. I don't hate the writers of those stories at all, nor do I think the quality of their writing is bad. The social justice warrior in me just gets absolutely worked up over some silly fictional stories about ladies with full bladders.

Ok, rant over.

Anyway this story is pretty great! I love the whole subversion of omorashi tropes, and girls peeing like guys is always welcome in my book.

}}

Glad you liked the story! 🥰 My issue with the trope is that it kinda... paints people with too broad a brush, if that makes sense. From some of them, you get the impression that all guys just pee wherever they want whenever they want, and no girl would ever even consider thinking 'outside the box' when trying to find relief. When I read those sorts of scenarios, it's hard to picture myself in them. Yeah, sure I have the parts that make peeing in unusual places physically simpler, but I'm so pee-shy that it's not likely to actually happen and I'll be getting as desperate as anyone else. Meanwhile, several of the girls I know wouldn't be too upset by having to pee outdoors so long as there was at least something to use for cover. Which is why I prefer stories using a set-up where some people can go and others can't to be more of a mixed bag; One where both men and women are getting desperate depending on how they specifically react to the situation as individuals.

I prefer situations where it's something personal about the character that's causing them to get desperate and not go. When I write a book, I kind of inevitably start thinking about which traits each of the characters have that could result in them having a hard time relieving themselves, and rarely does their physical sex factor into any of my imaginings there.

Will she actually use a video game urinal?

She may. I will need to find footage of the actual gameplay somewhere first though, so I can describe it accurately.

Contrary to what this story may imply, I haven't actually got anything against fedoras.

***

The comic convention had a ton of exciting things to check out. Cosplay competitions, autograph booths, and panels with voice actors and movie stars… But, after a large soda and a three hour bus ride to get there, the first thing Emmett wanted to check out was the men’s room. His bladder had been nagging him since he’d gotten onto the bus, and had been basically screaming at him the past half hour. There was a toilet on the bus that Shelby had suggested he use, but it was perhaps the most disgusting thing Emmett had ever seen so using it was completely out of the question.

It was a good thing he’d been to this convention center before, because if he’d needed to look for the restroom he’d burst long before he found it. He cringed when he saw there was a line out the door. Normally, there weren’t lines that long for the men’s, but he supposed this was a venue that attracted a lot of guys; And guys who tended to chug a bunch of energy drinks, at that. He got in line and immediately started pacing in place. He looked to the side and saw the line for the women’s was even longer, at least he didn’t have to get into that one. He was doubtful of his ability to stay dry even through this one! Maybe he should have just peed on the bus…

His need was absolutely critical, and the knowledge that there were toilets so near being used by other people was causing spasms to ricochet through his bloated bladder. He just kept dancing and trying to convince himself he could hold it.

A couple of the guys ahead of him had turned around and were staring at his obvious desperation. He felt his face practically catch fire under their scrutinizing stares, but he couldn’t stop himself from jumping in place if his life depended on it.

“Hey…” One of the guys said. “You need to go really bad?”

Emmett gave a tiny, humiliated nod. There was no point in denying that he was having an emergency. But, really, he thought there was no point in the guy asking him if he was, either. There weren’t any other reasons a person would be bouncing up and down with their legs crossed while in line for a toilet.

“You can cut ahead to the front, then,” the guy said.

Emmett must have heard wrong. “What?”

“Most of us are just here to check out the cool urinals,” one of the other guys laughed. “We don’t need to use ‘em that much.”

Emmett gave the man an odd look. He couldn’t fathom how a urinal could be that ‘cool’, but he wasn’t about to look a gift horse in the mouth. “I—If you’re sure,” he stammered.

A few of the guys stepped aside and let him through. To his surprise, when one of them explained that Emmett was in a hurry to the people further ahead in line, they allowed him to skip right ahead too. He wasn’t going to complain, his bladder loosened itself as he easily walked straight to the front of the line. He’d just have to wait for one of the urinals to open up, it would just be a second, and he knew he could last that long.

Once at the front of the line, he saw why those guys had claimed the urinals were ‘cool’. They had small screens mounted above them that displayed footage from a video game. At first, Emmett thought that society had become so commercialized that now people were being shown advertisements while they peed, but then he realized that it wasn’t an ad. It was an actual game that was controlled by how a person’s pee stream hit the urinal.

Gross.

Who thought that was a good idea? If anything, it was going to result in more ‘spills’ from people trying to adjust their aim too fast to get a higher score. Emmett hoped the floor around the urinals wasn’t too wet or sticky, because he had absolutely no choice but to use one of those within the next ten seconds. Or else the floor around him was going to get extremely wet and sticky.

Wait, hadn’t Shelby talked about these things once? Emmett wondered, beginning to sway back and forth on his feet as he urged the people who were midstream to hurry it up.

Yeah, she had. Of course, this was the kind of thing she’d get excited about. She’d probably want to use one of them…

Emmett immediately broke into a half-sprint as a urinal flushed and became available. He tugged down his zip and let it flow. Ahhhh, that was better! Against his better judgement, he looked up at the screen. It was a skiing mini-game, in which you steered by aiming your pee, and picked up speed the more forcefully you went. How utterly juvenile and… Emmett realized that, thanks to his desperation, his stream was blasting with the force of about six fire hydrants, and his score in the game was ticking up.

He tried not to care, but quickly found himself adjusting his stream back and forth to avoid obstacles. Okay… So maybe it was a little fun. A little. And… It felt strangely nice to feel his bladder deflating while he played a game. He’d always been annoyed whenever he’d had to pause playing something to handle his urinary needs, being able to do both at once wasn’t too terrible a feeling.

“Whoa, I’ve never seen anybody go so fast in that game,” a voice behind him said.

Emmett gave a little jolt, his stream diverting for a second before he corrected his aim again. He tilted his head just enough to see the guy that was standing beside him. This wasn’t a guy using the neighboring urinal, as Emmett had gotten the one at the far end. No, this was just… a guy standing there and watching him pee.

Emmett had thought all the posts he’d seen online about dudes with scraggly beards that wear fedoras having poor social skills were just memes, but apparently that was the case for at least one guy. Emmett tried to cover himself a bit with one hand, when he realized the guy wasn’t really trying to sneak any peeks at him, he was just watching the game screen. Which was maybe a little less weird, but still, he was just too close for comfort.

Emmett tried to finish up faster and bore down with his muscles a bit. His stream somehow managed to pick up even more force, and in the game he went even faster. “Whoa,” the fedora guy said again. Emmett felt himself blushing. Sure, this guy was just interested in the game, but at the end of the day what he was so impressed by was the fact that Emmett could pee really, really hard.

The faucet blast that had been gushing from Emmett’s tip for the last minute and a half finally slowed down to a dribble, he shook himself off and zipped back up. As he headed to wash his hands, the fedora guy followed him. Oh, come on, seriously? Emmett thought.

“You ever played that before? You’re really good.”

Emmett tried not to say anything mean, or do anything that would make his irritation obvious. “No,” he said. He’d just really, really needed to pee, that was all there was to it. He tried to wash his hands as fast as he could, but if there was one thing Emmett couldn’t do quickly, it was hand-washing. He had a very strict process he had to adhere to there. He needed the water to heat up enough to burn, he needed to rub the soap all over his hands and deep into the spaces between his fingers, he had to get it nicely beneath his fingertips, then rinse it off. And repeat the process three times. Only then could he feel clean.

“I thought you were gonna go so fast you’d make the game glitch,” the fedora guy continued. “You had real good control, too. You didn’t crash into anything. And, you made it last a long time, too. You must have broken the high score with that.”

This was so embarrassing. Having some guy he didn’t even know basically sing his praises because his bladder could hold a lot of pee, it came out with a ton of force whenever he’d been desperate, and he could aim his dick well. He tried to ignore the man and think of something else as he lathered his hands a second time. He remembered now that Shelby definitely had mentioned an interest in peeing into a urinal like that. She’d worn a cosplay today, one of the rare occasions she put on a skirt instead of pants, so he didn’t think she’d need to take off that much to use one here, wouldn’t need to expose much of anything. Too bad she couldn’t come in here, he guessed.

But, after a few more seconds, he thought maybe she could. The convention was pretty lax about things like that, and some of the cosplayers he’d seen already heading in here had been crossdressing. Shelby wouldn’t even be the only person wearing a skirt to come in here. He’d also stay with her the whole time, just in case Fedora Guy was still hanging around.

He wasn’t positive it was a good idea, but she’d be real annoyed if he didn’t at least ask her if she wanted to do this.

Finally, Emmett’s hands were clean enough by his standards, and he left, not saying one word to Fedora Guy.

“Of course I’d want to try it!” Shelby said. “Sounds fun! What score did you get?”

Emmett gave her the number.

“Okay, I gotta beat that,” Shelby decided.

“The only reason I scored that high was because I was about ten seconds away from peeing my pants,” Emmett said. “It kind of gauges how… Forcefully you’re—“

“Then, I’ll have to drink a bunch of sodas,” Shelby said.

“Are you sure that’s a good ide—“

“Am I sure kicking your ass is a good idea? Of course I am!”

Emmett sighed, “Shelby, I don’t even care about—“

“Sounds like something a loser would say.”

“Oh my God…”

Shelby led him in the direction of the concessions and left him at a table. A few minutes later she returned with a tray that contained nothing but huge cups of soda. Emmett sighed, “You know, I’m really hungry…”

“Go get some food, then,” Shelby said, picking up one of the massive cups and beginning to drink.

Emmett stood and went to get some food. When he came back with a basket of fries, he reached for one of the sodas, but Shelby slapped his hand away. “Nope, these are all mine!”

“You have five of them!”

“Yep, and I’m gonna need them,” Shelby said. “Gotta drink ’til I’m ready to burst.”

“There might be a line,” Emmett warned. “I mean, they might let you skip ahead if you’re desperate— They did that for me— But, still—“

“They’ll probably let me skip because they’ll think I’ll go out with them after, you know half these guys haven’t even seen a girl in four years.”

“That’s a stereotype,” Emmett said. “I’m sure they at least see their moms when they come up from her basement each week to get more hot pockets.”

Shelby reached a hand over and patted his cheek, “I’m glad you can see your future so clearly!”

“Oh, come on!”

Shelby did reluctantly hand over one of her sodas once Emmett fussed enough about the saltiness of the fries, but the rest she downed all on her own. She stood up and announced she was going to go get more, but Emmett stopped her. “I’m pretty sure if you drink a lot all at once it, like, goes through you super fast. I don’t think it’s a good idea to get even more after all that. Plus, I think you might die from water intoxication at this rate.”

“Okay,” she agreed.

So, they went off to explore the convention. They stopped at booths to buy a few things, went to see some panels, got a few autographs, and through it all Shelby got noticeably more and more desperate. Emmett kept asking if she was ready for a toilet break, but she kept saying that she didn’t think she had quite enough in her to beat his score. “When we got here, you could barely walk you had to pee so bad!” she reminded.

“Please, don’t say that so loud?”

She just carried on as if he’d said nothing; “But, I can still walk, so I don’t have to go bad enough yet.” She may have said she wasn’t at the bursting point yet, but her actions spoke louder. She had been dancing in her seat through the entirety of the last panel they’d seen. She’d cross one leg overtop of the other one, then switch them around instantly. She pulled her foot up onto her seat and pushed herself against her ankle. And now that they were walking again, her claims of still being able to do so were suspect. Yes, she was walking in the sense that she was able to transport her body from point A to point B, but very few people would actually classify her half-hunched, lilting hobble as much of a ‘walk’.

“Remember, we still have to actually get to the restroom,” Emmett said. “And you might have to wait a little bit more once we’re there, too.”

“I can wait,” Shelby said. They’d stopped walking, but Shelby was still moving. She took a few paces one way, then went back the other direction. She jiggled around in a tiny circle. She balled her hands into fists.

“Can you?” Emmett asked skeptically. “I don’t want to have to go home early because you had an accident trying to beat my score in a pointless game.”

“It’s not pointless,” Shelby said. “You’re just saying that ‘cause you know you’re gonna lose.”

“I don’t care if I lose,” Emmett said. “I care about riding the bus home with you covered in pee because you wouldn’t just go.”

Shelby winced, she didn’t want to admit how real that image sounded to her. “Okay,” she said. “I guess we should start heading over there soon.”

The walk to the men’s room wasn’t long, but Shelby couldn’t move that fast. The crowds were larger now, too, and every so often she’d get accidentally bumped by someone. The jolts kept sending urgent pangs through her full bladder, and she’d even ended up needing to cup herself a few times when she felt a few squirts of liquid trickle out of her. Once, a kid managed to elbow her middle by mistake and that nearly resulted in a total accident. She’d gone totally still and pressed her legs together, her hands clamping against her steadily dampening crotch until she finally got a handle on the situation again.

When they arrived at the restroom, Shelby was relieved that there wasn’t much of a line. Each of the urinals were taken, but there was only guy waiting ahead of her. She immediately started to bounce up and down. She could feel her underwear had already gotten quite wet during the walk over here. The clammy dampness was very noticeable between her trembling thighs. “I told you to go earlier,” Emmett reminded. “Are you going to make it oka—“

The guy in front of them turned around, and Emmett bit back a groan. It was the Fedora Guy. Again. “Whoa, awesome crossplay,” he said. “Your cleavage looks so real, how did you—“

Shelby removed her hands from between her legs and covered her chest, embarrassed. She didn’t normally wear anything so showy, and looks like the one that guy was giving her were a big part of the reason why. Her hands quickly returned to their spot, however, when a jet of pee hissed between her thighs. “It’s not a cosplay— Well, I mean, it is, but— I’m not crossdressing.”

“… Then, aren’t you in the wrong room?” Fedora Guy asked. “I mean, I guess it looks like you’re having an emergency, and the ladies’ room lines are always so long ‘cause girls are always doing their make-up in their and stuff. But,” he gestured to his side. “The stall here’s out of order, so you’re gonna have to go somewhere else.”

Fedora Guy kept rambling, and Shelby wondered how someone could reach his age and still have no idea how to communicate with a girl in a way that wasn’t insulting. Women’s room lines were not longer because of make-up, how utterly patronizing.

She didn’t have time to lecture the man on how to make less of an ass of himself though. She shifted her weight from foot to foot; “It’s okay, I don’t need a stall. I’m gonna beat my brother’s score on that urinal game.”

“I thought you said you weren’t crossdressing?” The Fedora Guy reminded.

“I’m not,” Shelby said. Her bladder throbbed and pulsed and pounded, and she was constantly dribbling little drops. “But, you are right that this is an emergency, can I cut ahead?”

“But… How are you gonna--"

“My sister can do a lot of things, people don’t expect” Emmett interrupted. “But, she can’t hold her pee indefinitely, so how about you let her through? You don’t look like you need the toilet that much.”

Fedora Guy stepped aside, “Proceed, m’lady,” he said.

Holy crap, Emmett thought. They actually say that? I thought it was just a meme!

Emmett realized that Fedora Guy's social skills were probably poor enough that he'd try and see for himself how Shelby did this. He decided to nip that in the bud and when a urinal finally opened, he stopped Shelby from rushing for it for a second. She whimpered as he grabbed her sleeve, cupping her hands against herself and feeling small trickles of urine cascading down her legs.

“Okay,” Emmett said a little timidly. He did not like speaking to strangers, but he disliked the idea of someone creeping on his sister about one hundred times more. “My sister is going to play this weird urinal game. I know that that’s… unusual, and probably not something you’ve ever seen before. But, that doesn’t make it okay to peek. You wouldn’t peek at a guy using a urinal, so don’t do it to her, either. If you must look in her direction at all, keep your eyes on the game. Nothing else. If you try to look somewhere you shouldn’t, just be aware that she has a green belt in karate.”

“Stand behind me while I go, okay?” Shelby asked. “Ohh, can I go now?!”

“Sure,” Emmett said. “And yeah, you can go now.”

Shelby rushed for the urinal and Emmett stood directly behind her to provide a little more privacy. She lifted the front of her skirt and lowered her underwear to just above her knees. She finally felt a bit of trepidation. The one other time she’d peed in a urinal at the hotel, it had been one that went all the way down to the floor. This one was raised up on the wall quite a bit, and she realized she was gonna have to stand on the tips of her toes to reach the target easily.

She didn’t have too much time to dwell on that, though. Her bladder had begun to dribble yet again, recognizing that she had reached a place where it could be emptied. She raised herself onto her toes and placed her hands into the correct positions, and told herself to relax. When she felt the tension in her middle start to ease away, she pushed down hard and a jet of urine sprayed forcefully from between her thighs, splashing against the porcelain. Oh, God… That felt better… “Ahhhh…” she exhaled, looking up to the screen. Her stream was so powerful that her in-game self was moving extremely fast, and she had to sway her hips slightly from side to side every few seconds to dodge obstacles.

“Wow…” Fedora Guy said, his eyes wide and mouth dropped open. “She’s actually doing it…”

“Eyes up there!” Emmett barked, gesturing to the game screen above the urinal. He knew there was no way he could see any of Shelby’s body with Emmett standing in the way, but it made him pretty tetchy to think the guy might be at least trying to get a peek.

Fedora Guy did listen to him at least, redirecting his gaze to the screen. “She’s really good…” he remarked.

“Quiet,” Emmett started to say, but Shelby interrupted with an enthusiastic “Thanks! Told you I could do it!”

“You’re going even faster than your brother was earlier,” he continued. “That’s super impressive.”

Shelby peed for quite a while, all those sodas had seriously stretched her bladder, she could feel the tight ball of tension that had rooted itself between her legs slowly shrinking away until it finally seemed to vanish altogether. As she became aware that her bladder was nearly empty, she pushed even harder to make sure the last drops would go out rather than straight down. Finally finished, she pulled her underwear back up and checked her score; “See?” she asked. “I said I’d beat you, and I did.”

Emmett shut his eyes, “Well, I’m glad you’re proud of yourself, I guess.”

“How’s it feel that a girl’s better at using a urinal than you are?”

“Oh my G— That’s not what… You can pee harder than I can, that’s all it is.”

“Sounds like something a sore loser would say.”

“... Did you have fun?”

“Yep.”

“Okay. I’m glad.”

“How did you do that?” Fedora Guy asked.

Emmett sighed, he’d almost forgotten about him.

“It took a lot of practice,” Shelby answered, but didn’t elaborate.

Okay, so I have a huge backlog of fiction updates to post to this site, but since I don't want to put up a ton all at once I'll just do a couple each day (Like, one chapter for each story). You can view my AO3 account if you want to see more right away. (Link to that on my profile.)

***

Shelby had not even known that it was physically possible to need to pee this badly. She brought her feet up onto the seat as she pulled her knees to her chest. She had to pee so badly that tears were rolling down her cheeks. She was cupping herself tightly, every bump in the road causing pain to flare through her.

She’d never felt such an intense, burning need to pee before in her entire life. Sweat dribbled down her forehead as her body shook, trying to protest against the violent call of nature. She registered every tiny pebble the car went over, even that slight bounce was trying to shake a wave out of her bladder.

To make matters worse, sheets of rain were pouring down the car’s windows as he tried to keep her bladder from squirting all of its contents out all over the seat beneath her.

“Dad, please?” Shelby begged. “Please pull over?”

“I can’t,” Dad responded. “There’s nowhere TO pull over.”

“Let me go on the side of the road!” Shelby pleaded. “Please?”

“No, I can’t,” Dad said.

“I bet you’d let Emmett do it!”

“I wouldn’t,” Dad said. “Look at all the lightning out there, it’s not safe. You’ll hurt yourself.”

Shelby just groaned again, and seemed to accept that begging wasn’t about to get her anywhere. She stared down at her shuffling feet, whining in the back of her throat with need as she tried and tried and tried to just hold on.

Shelby should have gathered by the way Emmett didn’t immediately blurt out something indignant a few moments ago when she’d claimed he would be allowed to pee on the side of the road, that her brother’s mind was elsewhere. But, when she heard him whimpering beside her, she finally picked up on it.

If Shelby had to go this badly, she realized Emmett surely must have needed it even worse; She’d peed the last time they’d stopped at a gas station, and he had refused to, citing the fact that gas station toilets were always repulsive. “Dad, come on!” Shelby whined, shoving her hands between her legs as she felt a tiny patch of warmth forming beneath her. “We both need to go!”

“There aren’t any stops,” Dad informed. “I promise, I’m looking, there just isn’t anywhere t—“

“Please!”

“It’s too dangerous!” Dad said. “It’s pouring rain, there’s lightning, it’s dark. I can’t.”

“Please! I’m literally about to pee myself!” Shelby begged.

“I’m really sorry,” Dad stated softly. “I can’t control the weather.”

Shelby went quiet. For a few minutes, the car was silent aside from the sound of the twins’ both whimpering and shuffling their legs around, and the noise of so much water pounding against the car from above. Didn’t Dad understand that if he didn’t pull over, there was gonna be an even bigger rainstorm INSIDE the car?

Beside her, Emmett was starting to think that if Dad DID stop the car on the side of the road, he might just bite the bullet and pee there. He’d let himself get soaked through with rain. He’d stand in what was sure to be a disgusting, muddy puddle. He’d whip it out and make the puddle even more revolting as he finally let his poor bladder relax for the first time in hours. “…Dad?” he asked nervously, hands drumming against the tops of his thighs. “It will just be for a minute…”

“Just hold on,” Dad said. “I’m trying to find somewhere. I promise, I’m trying as hard as I can. And we should be at the motel in just an hour, okay?”

Emmett couldn’t take another hour, he didn’t think. His body was quaking as he tried to keep his pee inside of his body where it belonged. His knees were bouncing and his legs were darting around in all directions as he tried to do the closest equivalent to a pee dance as he could while stuck sitting down. His hands shook as he finally tucked them between his legs. His body was so full of piss that he thought it would probably start coming out of his ears soon.

Shelby didn’t have pee coming out her ears, but the liquid inside of her was trying to find every possible exit. Sweat cascaded down her face and back, tears brimmed in the corners of her eyes. She had what felt like gallons of piss pressing against one rapidly weakening muscle. And, every few seconds it felt like even more flooded its way down.

Dad kept promising he was looking somewhere. And Emmett and Shelby both desperately stared out the windows of the car as well, but they saw nowhere. Shelby tried her best to cling onto the hope that she’d make it to the motel. But, her muscles were so sore, and she had to go so badly… Her hands were constantly moving, trying to press into her urethra as best she could, but it only brought her a little relief. She thought Emmett had it easier, he had more of something to actually hold and pinch onto to keep his flood at bay.

Emmett didn’t think he had anything easy, however. The havoc being flung through his own bladder as he stared at the gushing rain outside was horrific. Each painful bump in the road made him feel more and more like he was going to have an accident. He finally started to tear up as the effort was taking everything out of him. A sudden clap of thunder and shock of lightning startled him badly enough that a leak squirted into his clothes. “DAD!” He cried out as he felt his thighs dampening.

“What?” Dad asked. “Do you see a place?”

“N—No!” Emmett stammered, his straining, leaky, overburdened bladder felt like a heavy bowling ball in his middle. “But, I— Please, just stop!” he begged, his voice was cracking from the agonizing urgency inside him. His bladder was like an overflowing water balloon, and when he glanced down, it even looked that way. His abdomen was bulging, straining with gallons of pee.

“You saw the lightning,” Dad said. “It’s very dangerous out there. I’m sorry,” he repeated once more. “If either of you… If you two… can’t wait, I won’t be angry.”

Emmett cringed at the very thought of having an accident, even as the signals from his bladder were insisting to him that such an outcome was inevitable. The idea of having to ride in the car, humiliated, soaked and stinking with his own bodily waste made him want to cry, and he tightened his grip on himself. But, even so, drip after drip was forcing its way through his burning urethra.

Every bit of road the car jostled over sent pangs of need through Shelby’s body, jiggling her bladder around inside her abdomen and causing the waves to slosh and crash against its opening. Every breath she managed to suck in shook the walls of the bloated organ, and when she exhaled she couldn’t help but whimper. Her face burnt with embarrassment when she heard her Dad basically say that it was okay to pee her pants in the car. More tears came as she imagined that happening, her body quivered with stress, pain and embarrassment.

Shelby was stunned that her need was still getting worse. Already, it was so intense she could hardly believe she could be feeling something so heinous and not be at death’s door, but still it was continually worsening, building up more and more as her body just kept on dumping more liquid into a container that didn’t have any space left inside.

Many times, Emmett had said or heard someone else say that they needed to pee so badly they felt like they were going to explode. But, up until now, he had not known the real meaning of that phrase. All the other times he’d said it or thought it, he had been exaggerating. Because, now he genuinely did feel like he was going to explode and come apart, the pressure inside his body was inhuman. He moaned and ground his teeth together and tensed every muscle his body had, but none of it was enough to prevent short dribbles from breaking past his dam. He tried so hard to make it stop, but he just couldn’t do it.

“Dad?” Emmett managed softly through his pain. “Please? I don’t want to have an accident.”

Dad didn’t look back, he couldn’t any more. He couldn’t stand the sight of them both in so much pain, twisting up with no escape from their agony. It tore him up too much to see them suffering with no way to help. All he could do was apologize once more.

Eventually, the sign for the motel— the sign for relief— finally turned up on the side of the road. Both Emmett and Shelby cringed as the car suddenly turned off the highway, but even so, the jolt of the car changing direction had never been so welcome.

When the car was at last parked outside the motel, Emmett had to work very hard to let go of his dick in order to open the door and step outside. The moan from his sister’s lips told him she had fared no better.

The two stood close to the building to try and fend off the rain as best they could while Dad went to get the key, both focused only on not adding any extra liquid to the puddles that the storm had already created.

Just as Shelby felt a huge surge of need tear through her body, and a long jet of pee spurt into her clothes, Dad was back and leading her and Emmett to their room for the night. Shelby could have cried with relief when she realized it was on the ground floor; She wouldn’t have to try to climb up any stairs in her condition.

Dad stuck the key into the lock, “I’ll go get the bags from the car, you two just… Get comfortable, okay?”

Both of them danced in place as Dad turned the key, and the second the door was open, the two dashed inside the room as they had immediately seen what they needed.

Dad shut the door behind them just as Shelby said; “Outta my way, I’m going first!”

Emmett squeezed himself between his legs as he approached the door to the restroom, “No you aren’t!” He reached out to open the door, his bladder already loosening up in anticipation.

“Yes, I am!” Shelby insisted, shoving him.

Emmett cringed, trying to recover from the forcefulness of Shelby’s jab. He was incredibly thankful it hadn’t landed any lower, otherwise it would have been all over. “No, you aren’t! I have to go way worse!” He deserved to go first! He’d been holding it way longer than Shelby had, and he was now just barely able to keep his dripping under control enough that they wouldn’t be charged for the cost of cleaning the carpet! “You went at the gas station, I’ve been waiting longer!”

“That was your own fault!” Shelby said. She was no longer trying to keep her clothes dry, she could feel how wet the area between her legs had already gotten, and she’d gotten fairly water-logged in the rain as well. She just wanted to prevent a total flood that would likely destroy the carpet she was standing on. “Dad and I both told you to go there, and you wouldn’t!”

“That doesn’t change that I’ve been holding it way longer!” Emmett said, his legs coiling against each other as he tried again to grab the doorknob.

Shelby slapped his hand away and tried to get it herself, “Well, I’m smaller than you! So, I can’t hold as much!”

“By, like an inch!” Emmett said, grabbing her wrist and pulling her back. “Probably not even HALF an inch!”

“Nnnh, can we just go together!?” Shelby asked.

“There’s only one toilet, and I’m not gonna pee in the sink or the tub, so—“

“We can both use the toilet! We can stand next to each other!” Shelby said. “You know I can go standing up!”

“I really wish I DIDN’T know that!” Emmett said. Both hands had returned to their place between his tense thighs now. His drips had failed to stop or even slow down. “We can’t do that, it’s weird.” He felt like pointing out that, in all the time they’d spent arguing, he could have FINISHED peeing and she wouldn’t have to worry about it anymore.

“Fine, then I’m going first!”

Emmett couldn’t wait for Shelby to pee. He was wetting himself already as it was. If he had to listen to her go while still holding out, he’d explode for sure. “No you won’t, we’ll… We’ll go together!”

Once they were actually at the toilet they were both dying to use, however, they just continued to stand there, jiggling as their faces reddened. Shelby pulled her pants down first and positioned her hands in place, pulling up around her open slightly. Emmett stared straight down at himself as he unzipped and took aim.

Neither of them started peeing.

“Got a little stage fright?” Shelby asked.

“You’re not going either,” Emmett mumbled, trying to keep himself from fidgeting now that he was in the right place. He didn’t want to admit that Shelby was right. It was maybe a little stunning considering how intensely anxious he felt at all times, but THIS didn’t happen to Emmett very often. He could count on one hand the number of times he’d ‘frozen up’ while using a toilet, ordinarily his body just did what it had to do and he didn’t have to concentrate too much on making it happen. Especially if he’d been bursting. But, now, this was just too strange to him, and he couldn’t get his bladder to accept that it was time to empty.

“I’m holding it out of respect for you,” Shelby said. But, she knew it was a lie. Since Shelby needed to part her legs so much farther than Emmett did, the only way for there to be enough room for the both of them was if they both stood on either side of the toilet; meaning they were looking right at each other. It was so awkward that it made her exhausted muscles suddenly remember how to maintain tension.

Emmett sighed. “It… It takes a second,” he said. He shut his eyes, and listened to the rain still noisily pouring outside. Soon enough, he felt the slight pinch in his muscles that usually came right before he started peeing, and a second after that, the first drops of his burden began to noisily trickle into the toilet. He exhaled lightly through his nose, trying not to moan as he was all too aware that he wasn’t alone.

Hearing Emmett’s stream, seeing it flow into the toilet and ripple the water in the bowl, was too much for Shelby and a light yellow stream emerged from between her legs with an intense force, gushing into the toilet. “Ahhhh…” she breathed out. “Muuuuch better.”

“Please don’t talk…” Emmett said. He was trying to enjoy the relief of finally letting it out after so much painful restraint, her trying to speak to him was making him remember just how weird the whole thing was. His eyes were still welded shut, the only reason he’d known he wasn’t making a mess was because he could hear his pee striking the water, but now that Shelby was going as well it was a little less easy to tell if his aim was still good.

Apparently it wasn’t though, because Shelby said; “Open your eyes, silly. I thought you hated making messes.”

Emmett cracked his eyes open, and realized he was spattering the rim a bit. He corrected his aim, blushing bright red.

Shelby’s stream shrunk down and stopped gushing. Maybe Emmett HAD needed it worse than her, she realized. He’d started peeing before her, but now that she was done, he was still spraying away.

After a few more seconds, Emmett finished with a small shiver. He shook off and began to zip up.

“Why do you do that?”

“Do what?” Emmett asked.

“That shivery thing,” Shelby said. “You shake whenever you’re almost finished peeing.”

“I hate that you’ve apparently seen me pee enough times to notice a pattern.” Emmett tore off some toilet paper to mop up the little spill he’d had on the rim of the bowl. He tried not to notice that Shelby hadn’t gotten anything on the rim herself, even though that was surely much more difficult for her to accomplish.

“I haven’t seen you go THAT many times,” Shelby said. “But, like, every time I have, you do that.”

“It’s involuntary,” Emmett said. “I don’t know why it happens, does it not happen to you?”

“I can’t remember ever doing that,” Shelby said. “Doesn’t it mess up your aim?”

“No, please stop talking about it,” Emmett said. “In fact, can we agree never to mention any of this ever again?”

*020*2022-02-05 18:05

Shelby was having a major emergency. This was not the kind of need-to-pee that played around. It was the kind that made it hard to walk, hard to breathe, hard to do anything other than crumpling into a ball and losing the battle against her own body. Truthfully, she was amazed she hadn’t peed her pants yet. She’d been holding it for so long she’d actually forgotten what it felt like NOT to have a painfully stretched ball of urine in her center.

This had been one of the worst days of her life.

Her school had recently increased the length of each class. And as a result the time allotted to students between classes simply was not enough. Especially when each consecutive class was located on different sides of the building from one another. They were given a minute and a half to get their things and make it to their next class. Shelby had already been marked late so many times that she was at risk of having to serve a weekend detention if she did it one more time.

Ninety seconds just was not long enough to walk from one end of the building to the other if she paused for a pee break in between. Partway through the morning, her need had been great enough to prompt her to attempt it, but the instant she’d touched the door to the ladies’ room, the warning bell had rang and she’d needed to hurry to class.

She tried instead to go at lunch, which caused her to spend the entire half hour jiggling around in an extremely long line and wishing everyone in front of her would hurry up. Not only did she end up not having time to eat anything, she hadn’t even had time to pee. By the time the line had moved forward enough for her to actually get INSIDE the restroom that she was dying to use, it was time to go back to class.

She spent the latter half of the school day fidgeting and bouncing at various desks. She asked numerous times for a pass to go use the restroom, only to be told that she needed to make better use of the time she had in between classes and at lunch. Her explanations that she had TRIED to go then but there just wasn’t enough time all fell on deaf ears.

During her final class, she was so absolutely bursting that she considered just standing up and walking out of the room. A lecture about how the mitochondria was the powerhouse of the cell or whatever it was her teacher was blathering on about was not as important as keeping her bladder from literally exploding. If anyone tried to stop her, she’d ignore them.

But, she knew the penalty would be a detention, and she just couldn’t have one today. It was her Dad’s birthday, and she and her brother had been planning to surprise him by paying for a meal at his favorite restaurant. If she had to spend a couple hours in detention, that whole idea would be ruined. So, she had to just sit there and hold it. As soon as class was over, she could run to the toilet for a well deserved pee.

After what felt like several years, class was dismissed and Shelby found herself in an agonizingly long line yet again. It was a struggle not to cup herself as she swayed back and forth at the end of the line. Sweat was gushing down her back. She kept looking longingly across the hall at the men’s room. There was a line there too, but it was nowhere near as long. And it was moving MUCH faster. She wished she could join THAT one instead. It wouldn’t even be the first time she’d peed in a men’s restroom! She wished she could just get in that shorter, faster line and be peeing within a few minutes. And, if a urinal was what became available to her first, that would be what she used— Even though she tended to relieve her bladder sitting down at school unless the room was empty, not wanting to become the subject of cruel rumors.

But, she knew that going into the men’s restroom and using a urinal would probably net her a detention as well. To say nothing of the teasing she’d endure afterwards. She just had to wait. Even if waiting was really, really hard and it felt like a fist was being squeezed around her bladder every time she managed to hear a toilet being flushed from inside the room she was waiting for.

She saw Emmett coming down the hall and when he approached her, she almost asked him for assistance with getting into the men’s room. She wasn’t so sure what she expected him to do to help with that, but she needed SOMETHING.

Before she could ask him anything, however, he said; “I’m really sorry, but we have to leave, we can’t be late getting home today.”

“I can’t!” Shelby said. “I have to go! I’ve been waiting all day!”

“I know," Emmett said. The new school bus route meant it would drop them off several streets away from their house. “If you can’t wait, I’m sure there will be somewhere you can go during the walk home.

Shelby wanted to protest, wanted to beg to be allowed to stay in line until her turn finally came and she could rid herself of this horrendous pressure. But, there were still SO MANY people ahead of her, and she knew that by the time she got into a stall, the bus would have left. They’d need to walk all the way home, and they’d end up being totally late.

Reluctantly, she stepped out of the line that led to her relief and followed her brother to the exit of the school. The whole way, she was stumbling and almost falling over, trying her best to walk and keep her legs crossed at the same time. Emmett kept apologizing over and over, and promising her that she’d be able to go as soon as they got off at their stop.

The ride itself was horrific. Each bump the bus went over was felt with fiery intensity in her bladder. She pressed her hands deep into the material of her pants and several times still felt short spurts of urine squirt out. She chewed on her lip and fought not to moan.

Emmett felt horrible watching her struggle, thinking now that he should have just forgotten about their surprise for Dad and just let her keep bouncing in line until she finally got what she needed. “I’m sorry,” he repeated over and over again, until ‘sorry’ no longer sounded like a real word.

“I’m gonna explode,” Shelby muttered. “They’re gonna have to call in professional cleaners to scrape my urine flecked remains off of the bus.”

“Um… Wow, that’s an image,” Emmett said. “But, you can make it!” He encouraged. “You can do it!”

But, Shelby couldn’t be that confident. It had been so many agonizing hours since she’d last seen a toilet and her bladder was outright searing. Her pants, normally loose and comfortable, now felt like daggers poking into her protruding abdomen. Her hands were pressing so forcefully against herself that they were beginning to go numb. Her legs were tied up in a way that she hadn’t even known they could bend. And still, the bus hit more bumps, jostling more and more teeny, tiny spurts of pee out of her aching body.

They at last arrived at their stop, and Shelby seemingly had to relearn how to walk all over again. It was like she’d forgotten how feet even worked. She was so doubled over on herself that she was practically crawling. The giggling from a few of her classmates made rage fire through her chest. It wasn’t like she’d done this to herself on purpose! She’d been trying to take a leak all blasted day!

Once off the bus, she removed one of her hands from the crease of her legs and gripped Emmett’s shoulder. “Find me a toilet right now, or I swear to God I’m going to break everything you own.”

Emmett cringed once more. “It’s okay,” he tried to assure. “See, there’s a store right across the street, let’s—“ Before he could finish, Shelby was already rushing for it as quickly as she could manage on her wobbling, pained legs.

Emmett was about to scold her for not checking for cars before crossing the road, but stopped himself. She was okay, and she was definitely in no mood for a lecture now. He hurried after her, and as soon as the automatic doors slid open and he’d stepped inside the store, he heard Shelby groan.

Fearful she’d had an accident before reaching the toilet, he rushed in the direction of the sound. But, that wasn’t the problem. Shelby was still dry. And still very, very full of pee. The restroom was out of order. “God hates me,” Shelby muttered to him.

“No, that’s— There are other stores we can try!” Emmett said. “There’s one right next door, just—“

Shelby was already limping off.

Their luck wasn’t much better at the next store, though. Shelby shoved her way inside the building and immediately asked the cashier for the restroom. But, the cashier had shook her head. “You have to buy something first,” she said.

Shelby had then turned to her brother, “Please, buy something!” she begged.

Emmett patted his pocket. He had money, but it was the money he’d saved for Dad’s Birthday… Deciding that preventing Shelby from ending up in the hospital with an exploded bladder was worth having to settle for a slightly cheaper meal, he started to look around the store.

He hadn’t realized until then what the store actually sold. Once he got a good look at the merchandise, he felt a little nervous being in here at all. This store was filled with shelves containing tiny semi-translucent, and obviously very fragile, glass figurines. They were shaped like birds, with incredibly tiny, narrow beaks that looked like they could be broken right off with the smallest hint of pressure. Gingerly, he took one from a shelf and looked at the pricetag tied around it.

Holy crap.

The money he’d saved for Dad’s dinner wouldn’t even pay for a quarter of that! “Umm… How much is the cheapest one?” Emmett asked.

The cashier named a figure.

It was a little lower than the number on the pricetag, but not by much. Emmett looked at his sister, and thought he really should try to get her out of this store. With as much as she was jumping around, twisting and turning and pacing small circles, there was a risk she’d knock some stuff over and the two of them would have to work here for the rest of their lives to pay for it. “Shelby, I’m sorry. Unless you have a winning lottery ticket with you, we have to go somewhere else…”

Shelby, plunging her hands back between her thighs, limped and stumbled up to the counter. She stared at the cashier and tried giving her The Eyes. Dad could never say no to her when she looked at him this way, and she hoped the cashier would be the same way. She widened her eyes, staring straight up at the cashier, and she allowed tears to build up in the corners of her eyelids— Which was easier to do now than on previous attempts, the pain of her overburdened bladder was probably enough to make even the strongest man in the universe cry. “Please?” she asked. “Can’t you make an exception just once?”

The cashier just shook her head.

“C—Come on,” Emmett said. “We’ll find somewhere else.”

The tears began to slide down Shelby’s face then, and it took a lot of effort not to just start sobbing. She couldn’t believe she was getting THIS upset over simply needing to pee, but she was! She followed Emmett back out of the store, not daring to move her hands away from her crotch. She felt her cupped palms growing damp with what she hoped was sweat. ‘Oh, please, please, let it be sweat!’ she mentally begged. But, when the next leak squirted out past her barriers, she felt the full brunt of it burning through her opening and knew she was losing it. “I can’t hold it,” she whimpered.

“I know,” Emmett said, patting her arm gently. His eyes were bouncing all over the place and he felt almost as frantic with desperation as Shelby did. Where else WAS there? All he could think of was the little park they passed on their way home. The park didn’t have a restroom, but it did have loads of trees and bushes… “The park,” he said. “You’re okay with going outside, right?”

“Yes,” Shelby said eagerly. She was okay with going anywhere at all! Her bladder was so catastrophically full, leaking out more and more by the second. Her eyes hadn’t stopped leaking either, like all the liquid trapped in her body was trying to exit it through whatever opening it could find.

They continued on the road that would lead them home. “How much longer?” Shelby asked, her voice filled with urgency.

“You know how close we are,” Emmett responded.

“I know, I know, I’m just… I don’t think I can wait much more!” Shelby’s bladder violently twitched and a fresh wave of her urine splashed against her clenched palms. All of her steps were managing to somehow be equal parts frantic and precise. Frantic because she could NOT hold still if her life depended on it, and precise because she knew one wrong move would cause her to lose everything in one massive, hissing rush. She could see it so clearly, so vividly that was almost real, she’d mistakenly thwack her foot against the pavement too hard, the vibration would travel up her leg, clobber her bladder and all the boiling hot piss she’d been withholding for so long would pour down her legs in an instant.

Following her nightmarish fantasy, one more jet of pee spurted from her. She came to a dead stop and clenched her muscles together as tight as she could. As she fought to regain control, she made a solemn vow to never drink anything ever again! Surely, there had to be SOME way to survive without water, SOME way to ensure she’d never have to feel THIS again.

As her thoughts grew more chaotic, disjointed and nonsensical, she finally got herself walking again, her legs wobbly as she kept instinctively crossing them together. Finally, they were at the entrance to the park. “Okay,” Emmett said. “You can—“

Shelby was already making her way into the bushes. The bushes didn’t even look like bushes to her, they had transformed into toilet stalls, all vacant and ready for use. Her body once more began to loosen itself up, another trickle darting out, but she didn’t care. She was going to pee in just a few more seconds and it would feel wonderful… She dragged her hands from between her legs and hooked her fingers into her pants, beginning to pull them down, and—

Then she heard it. Children’s voices. She peeked out from the cover of the bushes and saw a large group of little kids gathered around an old man in the field. Obviously some sort of sports team. She felt heat rise and a horrible feeling take root in her stomach. There were KIDS right there! She couldn’t— What if one of them came back here and— No. She couldn’t risk… Doing this in full view of a child. Being… Exposed like that in front of a kid. That would be so wrong, sick.

She tried to ignore those thoughts, told herself that the odds one of the kids would come back here at all were pretty slim, that if it did happen, then any normal person would see she’d just had an emergency and couldn’t hold her bladder, and not assume she was a creepy, perverted flasher.

Trying to make up her mind, her bladder losing more drops by the second, her decision was made for her when a soccer ball soared through the air and right beside the bush. Then one of the children started to run after it. Shelby let go of her waistband and put them back between her legs instead, then stumbled back onto the sidewalk.

Emmett took one look at her and knew she still had to go. “What’s—“

“There are kids playing soccer,” Shelby said. “I can’t do that around—“

“Okay, can you make it home?” Emmett interrupted, already resuming the walk.

Taking a deep breath, Shelby forced the muscles around her bladder to contract and sucked back in. She willed herself to move forward with her brother. “I have to,” she said. She was out of any other options. As she kept wobbling and hopping along, she could not help but imagine the ecstasy that awaited her at home. She was pretty sure this was the first time in her life that she’d seriously actively fantasized about simply… taking a long, hard piss. 

This was the first time in her life that she’d found herself lost in a daydream of getting to a restroom and allowing waves and waves of suffering and torment to pour from her. Maybe she’d do it sitting this time, as she honestly thought the relief she’d feel would be enough to bring her down onto her knees if she stood, and it was likely to fill her brain with so much static she wouldn’t be able to aim. She could just fling herself onto the toilet and allow her body to give out, every nerve ending within her going slack with pleasure and relaxation…

It would make everything else that had happened today worth it.

But, first she had to make it.

And, dwelling so much on how good peeing was gonna feel was not making that easy. She knew already that, even if she managed to save herself from a total accident, she would need to change her pants before dinner. She could feel how sodden and heavy all her leaks had made the material. It squelched between her trembling fingers and rubbed clammily against her quivering thighs.

Again, despite knowing the answer, she begged Emmett “Are we close?”

“Yes,” Emmett said. He began to wonder if she was so desperate that she had become semi-delirious from it. “Just one more street, just one more,” he said.

‘One more street,’ Shelby repeated to herself. ‘I can do this.’ But, her bladder wasn’t so agreeable. Squirts and streams continued to shove past her defenses, and she knew she was kidding herself. She couldn’t do this. She WASN’T doing this. She was having an accident. It was happening slowly, but it was still very much happening. She just had to keep telling herself that there was still a chance she’d manage to at least FINISH in a toilet.

What could not have been more than five minutes, but felt a lot more like five years, later, they were at their front door. The instant Shelby realized that, the strangest thing happened; She somehow managed to feel even more desperate to pee than she had even seconds before. She’d felt ready to explode for hours, but now she felt like she was actively exploding right there. “Ah—!” she cried out, doubling over and pressing her hands into herself as tightly as she could.

What followed then was not a leak, not a spurt, not a dribble, but the harsh, pounding gushing spray of a stream she’d been straining to hold back for so long. “Hurry!” she begged.

Emmett was already twisting the key in the door, and he heard the lock open up a second later. He pulled the door open. “You made it!” he said. “you did it! You can—“

Shelby couldn’t move, and she definitely couldn’t stop peeing. She’d gotten so close, made it home, but she could NOT make it one more step. Her bladder had torn itself open, pee was spraying down her legs, creating the loudest hiss she thought she’d ever heard. “Oh… Oh my God…” she moaned when she realized that she’d done it, she’d lost the fight and was drenching herself completely.

“O—Oh,” Emmett said. He stepped back out of the house. He didn’t think it would be good for her to come inside before she was… done, but he didn’t want anyone else to see her this way… He stepped around her and stood in front of her, blocking her from the view of the street as she continued to violently flood her pants and the welcome mat beneath her feet with piss. He didn’t know what to say. Or, for that matter, if he SHOULD say anything at all. Telling her it was ‘okay’ again didn’t sound right, because obviously it wasn’t. She was having an accident, even after enduring all that pain for so long. That wasn’t okay at all.

Shelby’s flood went on and on and on, and to her dismay, it felt… So good. The tension was gone from her body, the agonizing boulder that had been weighing her down was shrinking little by little. Her muscles were all gently going slack. And it felt good. It was such a relief. Her faucet finally began to slow down to a weak drizzle and then to only occasional drops. And then she was finished. And absolutely soaked. “Oh my God…” she repeated.

“Are… Are you alright?” Emmett asked, still struggling to think of what to say.

“I… I wet myself,” Shelby said. That much was obvious, but she was in such a state of shock that she could barely believe it.

“I kno—” Emmett stopped himself. “It… Happens,” he said. “How long were you… Um… How long were you waiting?”

“All day,” Shelby said, the tears coming back at the unfairness of it all. “I went before school, and I tried so hard to— To find somewhere. I tried to get to a toilet for so long, Emmett. Why did I have to pee myself anyway when I tried so hard?”

“It’s… It’s not fair,” Emmett agreed. “This shouldn’t have happened. The school should have known that one minute is not enough time between classes, and… I shouldn’t have made you get on the bus,” he admitted. “I knew how much you had to go, I knew you hadn’t been all day, and I made you leave the line anyway. Dad would have been just as happy if we saved the dinner surprise for the weekend, and instead I hurt you.”

“You didn’t… You didn’t hurt me,” Shelby said.

“You were in pain,” Emmett said. “And I’m sorry. I—“

“I feel better now,” Shelby said. “And, when I… Lost it, you made sure nobody would see, that was good. And, from now on, if a teacher says I can’t pee during class, I’m gonna walk over to the garbage can and do it there. I bet they’ll change the rules really fast then.”

Emmett hoped Shelby wouldn’t ACTUALLY do that… “Um—“

“I’m kidding,” Shelby said. “I think.”

“So, you’re okay?”

“Yeah, I’ll be fine. I’ll go… Clean up for dinner, and we can forget about this.”

Emmett nodded, then looked down and wondered how exactly welcome mats were supposed to get washed.

I'd love a story where Shelby tries on some men's underwear like boxers, briefs, or tighty-whities (Not Emmet's though, like buying her own) and tries to pee standing through the fly of them.

Oh, good idea!

*024*2022-05-26 18:22

Standing up to pee was ridiculously convenient, so much better than having to find a proper toilet to sit on or a spot with enough room to squat down. Shelby had gotten much, much better at doing it, too. She rarely had any stray, leftover dribbles rolling down her legs after finishing anymore.

But, she didn’t think she’d perfected it yet.

The realization that there was one last hurdle to cross came when she saw Emmett desperate once more after a long day out at the park, during which he’d refused to pee in the disgusting portable toilets— Not that she could really blame or tease him for THAT, even she thought those things were revolting, to a person with contamination anxiety they must have been nightmare-inducing Hell-holes.

He’d rushed into the house the moment she’d unlocked the front door, and ran directly for the toilet. He was so eager to go that he didn’t have time to shut the door behind himself. He bobbed up and down for a couple more seconds as he yanked his zipper down, and was pissing forcefully as soon as that obstruction was out of the way of his stream— Not a moment too soon!

If he’d had to take the time to pull his pants DOWN all the way, he would have wet them for sure…

Shelby still had to pull HER pants down fully, even when she stood to go. She was seeing now how inconvenient that was. It took longer— And in an emergency situation that could be bad. And it meant she still couldn’t just… go against a wall or something out in the open. Just turning her back and trying to pretend that she was looking down at her phone like she’d noticed guys doing from time to time wouldn’t do a thing to conceal what she was actually up to— She’d be totally exposed, her butt on full display to anybody who happened to notice her.

Shelby had never tried to pee just through the zipper of her pants. She’d always assumed it wouldn’t be possible, that she’d just end up soaked. But, as she thought more about it, visualizing herself doing it, she realized that the main obstacle she always got stuck on was just… What to do with her underpants.

Her underwear didn’t have a flap for her to pee through. Of course they didn’t. Most girls only sat to pee, an opening like that on a pair of women’s underwear would just be useless and strange looking to ninety nine percent of the people buying them. If she HAD underpants with a fly though, then she could imagine herself shooting her pee through them without having to pull them down.

That meant she’d have to get underwear that had been designed for men. She’d bought men’s clothing before, sometimes a shirt she liked would only be made in men’s sizes for some annoying reason, so going into that section of a store wasn’t new to her. Getting guys’ underwear felt a little different to her, though. There were some girls at school that teased her for not living up to their own ideas of what being ‘feminine’ was. Sometimes they’d say she was practically a man, or make jokes about her needing to shave off some invisible mustache. She always tried not to care about anything those girls said, Shelby liked who she was, yet some of the comments really got to her anyway.

But, it wasn’t as though those girls would ever know what sort of underwear she had on. Nobody would be able to tell once her pants were on overtop of them.

Shelby went to the store one Saturday while her Dad was at his office, getting it ready for his job’s yearly Christmas party.

There were more underwear options for guys than Shelby had expected. Some looked a lot like the boy-shorts Shelby usually wore, but with the all-important fly. She spent some time examining the openings, trying to find pairs that she thought would be easy to pee through. Some of them had their openings positioned too far to one side or too high up and Shelby knew that they wouldn’t work. She picked some pairs that looked like they may be a bit large on her, thinking that if she had more space for her pee to flow through she’d have a better chance at pulling this off without making a mess.

She paid for the boxers easily, feeling silly that she’d been worried about the cashier giving her funny looks for buying them.

Back at her house, Dad still wasn’t back yet, so it was a good time to begin the experiment. Standing to pee was usually a lot easier if she had a decent amount of liquid inside her bladder. Doing it when she just barely had to go usually meant that her stream wouldn’t have enough force behind it to spray and arc out the way it needed to.

She got changed into just her pajama shirt and boxers, then entered the kitchen to get something to drink. Emmett was at the table, working on an assignment for school. He watched as his sister began to guzzle down a bottle of water as if she hadn’t had a sip of anything in days. “What are you doing?” he asked. He glanced down. “Heh, what are you wearing?”

“I’m gonna see if I can pee through the hole in these,” Shelby informed, pausing in her water-chugging for a second.

Emmett stared at her for a moment. He doubted that that would be possible— Then again, he wouldn’t have ever believed Shelby could stand to go at all if he hadn’t seen it with his own eyes. “If you buy boxers again, I’m gonna have to help you pick some that aren’t so goofy looking.”

“What’s wrong with them?”

“They’ve got little smiley faces all over them,” Emmett pointed out, thinking they probably wouldn’t want to be smiling if Shelby ended up peeing on them.

“Well, all the blank ones were boring,” Shelby said. “Besides, I was paying more attention to the opening in them, anyway.”

“You went out and bought men’s underpants JUST to do some weird peeing game thing with them?”

Shelby shrugged, “I don’t want to pull my pants down all the way when I pee!” she said. “Just because YOU did that off and on until you were nine doesn’t mean I should still be—“

“I stopped that WAY before I was nine!” Emmett protested, his chest, neck and face all feeling uncomfortably hot.

Shelby shook her head, “I walked in on you like that in the middle of the night SO many—“

“I was half asleep those times! That’s different!”

“Either way, I’d like to be able to go WITHOUT having to get half-naked, so I’m gonna have to figure this out.” Shelby re-filled her water glass.

Half an hour later, following her extremely rapid consumption of four large glasses of water, Shelby was beyond ready to give it a try. In the restroom, her bladder aching at the sight of the toilet, she opened the fly on the boxers and hit a wall…

She needed to use TWO hands to aim her stream correctly, but she needed one to hold the boxers open. But, just as she’d never actually TRIED to pee through a zipper and had merely assumed it wasn’t possible, she’d also never tried to aim with only one hand.

Knowing better than to make her first one-handed attempt with clothes on, she stepped out of the boxers and into the tub. If she could hit the drain with only one hand, then she’d try it through the fly next time she had to pee. She parted her legs, and rather than placing both hands over her crotch and using them to part her labia, she tried to do the same thing using the fingers of just one hand. It didn’t feel as stable, and when she pulled her fingers up and forwards, it was harder to apply the pressure equally on both sides than it was when she used two hands.

In spite of her anxiousness, Shelby really did have to pee, and now that she was in the tub— A place she’d peed more times than she could count— Her stream burst forth eagerly. To her immense satisfaction, her pee sprayed forwards rather than down her legs, just like it was supposed to. She was mostly hitting the drain too, only missing for a few seconds at a time.

She was so focused on mastering this new, one-handed method that the relief of her bladder emptying out didn’t register until she’d already been peeing for quite some time and her mind had relaxed now that it knew she was successful. Once she stopped worrying, the sensation of shrinking taking place within her was magnificent. She sighed happily to herself as her stream began to slow— This was always the hardest part!

She bore down hard on her muscles as her pee receded, the force and power of her stream rapidly dwindling. She tried her best to make it continue blasting out in a pressurized rush, but a little bit rolled down her leg anyway.

Oh well… That could be wiped off. And now she knew how to pee with only one usable hand.

She exited the restroom. Emmett was on the couch now, watching some documentary about some author Shelby had never heard of. He looked over at her, “Oh, hey. You’re dry.”

“I didn’t try it through the boxers yet,” Shelby said. “I realized I was gonna have to do it with one hand, so I had to practice that first in the tub. It worked though!” she smiled.

Emmett grimaced. He knew Shelby peed in their shower, but he tried really hard not to think about it! That wasn’t easy to do when she decided to INFORM him that she’d just done it! “I didn’t hear the water come on… Please tell me you rinsed it out, at least?”

“I drank a lot,” Shelby reminded him. “My pee was super clear, it was basically just water anyways.”

“Shelby…”

“And most of it went down the drain,” Shelby said. “I have good aim.”

“Oh my God…” Emmett groaned. “What about the rest of it? Did you—“

“YES,” Shelby sighed. “I ran the water for a few seconds.”

“You did?”

“Uh-huh… Um… On an unrelated note, I have to go… Do something…” Shelby backed away, returning to the restroom.

***

Shelby had guzzled two more glasses of water in the last half hour, and she didn’t think everything she’d had earlier had finished filtering through her yet, either. In fact, she knew it couldn’t have, because although she’d just peed thirty minutes ago, her bladder was begging her to go do it again.

Shelby stood, made her way to the restroom, determined to actually do it this time. She parted the flaps of the boxers and held them open, then made a V shape with her index and middle fingers. She spread her labia apart, just like before, and pulled her fingers up. She was ready to go.

But, her body seemed to decide that IT wasn’t.

She winced. Her bladder was uncomfortably full… And looking at the toilet was making it a whole lot worse. Shelby kept telling herself to let go, but her muscles remained steadfast in their mission to keep her pee at bay. She had a fairly good idea of what the problem was; This felt REALLY freaking weird.

She was deeply aware of how the fabric of the boxers felt around her waist. After years and years of her body knowing that it wasn’t supposed to urinate if her pants were up, the habit was tough to break. It had been a little tricky telling herself to go while standing up the first several times, too. But, her bladder always got the message after enough time had passed. Hopefully, this would be the same.

She stood there, her legs parted, her fingers carefully positioned, and her bladder refusing to surrender its contents as it throbbed and throbbed with needful urgency. “Nnnh,” she grunted quietly, pushing down hard on her pelvic muscles, trying to expel her pee through brute force alone. But, this didn’t work.

Several minutes passed, during which Shelby began to seriously sweat. The pressure within her abdomen was growing from a dull ache into a sharp pang. She was utterly confused by the fact that she could need to pee so much, and yet not be able to do it. She tried shutting her eyes, telling herself that her pants actually were all the way down and so there was no reason not to let it flow, but that didn’t work. She could feel the fabric encasing her thighs much too well.

She heard a knock on the door and jumped, fingers nearly losing their all-important position. “Shelby? Are you okay?” Emmett asked. “I kinda need to go, too…”

“Go use Dad’s bathroom!” Shelby called back.

“I can’t, there’s a spider in there the size of Rhode Island.”

“Rhode Island’s the tiniest state, so what’s the big deal?!”

“… Shelby, did you make a mess?”

“No!”

“If you had an accident, I’m not gonna make fun of y—“

“That’s not the problem!”

“Then, what is the problem?”

Shelby groaned and looked back at the toilet, trying very hard to focus on the task at hand. She didn’t want to tell him what the issue was! It was such a ridiculous, silly issue! But, when another minute passed, her pee still failed to flow and Emmett called “Shelby, come on… I have to pee, and that spider’s freaking me—“

“I can’t go, alright?” Shelby admitted.

“Huh?”

“It feels weird trying to go with my pants up, so I can’t—“

“Then take them down.”

“No, I want to know that I can do this.”

“Then, can you find out later?” Emmett asked. “After I’ve—“

“No, I’m bursting,” Shelby said, annoyed. “Either wait your turn, or try to ignore the spider.”

On the other side of the door, Emmett sighed and tensed his thighs together. Shelby was being so silly… But, he knew HE was, too. The spider in Dad’s bathroom was enormous and grotesque looking, but he didn’t think it was venomous. It couldn’t actually hurt him.

And he sort of understood Shelby’s problem. He’d felt something vaguely similar a few times. He was honestly a little surprised he didn’t have it happen more often, given his anxious nature. Every once in a while if he was at a urinal and someone was next to him, he’d have trouble getting his stream to start. It didn’t happen EVERY time he tried to pee next to somebody, but it was often enough that he’d noticed the pattern. Ordinarily, his problem would clear right up as soon as someone flushed a toilet or turned on a sink, the sound of the water would be enough to help him pee.

“Turn the sink on,” Emmett suggested.

“Um… My hands are kind of… I got ‘em right where I need ‘em. Can you do it? The door’s unlocked.”

Emmett groaned, this whole thing was ridiculous… He opened the door and quickly turned on the sink. He tried not to look at Shelby. He didn’t think he’d ever stop thinking this… hobby? Talent? Whatever this was, he couldn’t help but think it was really bizarre.

Shelby focused her attention on the running water, ripples of urgency crashed about inside her bladder, her sphincters twitching until she felt right at the very edge of letting go…

But, then it stopped again.

This sensation of almost-but-not-quite starting to pee repeated itself several more times. She swore her liquid was pressing at the very edge of her opening, unable to make it that last tiny sliver of a millimeter downwards. “Hnnnh, come on…”

The water didn’t seem to be helping Shelby, and it certainly wasn’t helping Emmett; His hips had begun to sway and shift. “Um… If you still can’t, could I maybe—“

“Hold on,” Shelby said. “I almost had it!”

Emmett grimaced, he hated himself for what he was about to say, but having to hold it for THIS long inside his own home was really irritating him. And, at least this wouldn’t be the FIRST time they’d done this together, as strange as that was. “Can you move over a bit, then? I’m sorry, I just need to—“

Emmett’s embarrassing plea was interrupted by the sound of a second jet of liquid joining the one pouring from the sink. Shelby’s bladder had finally accepted that it was, indeed, time to empty, and the hiss of it striking the bowl was loud enough to overpower the faucet.

Shelby watched, feeling equal parts amazed and proud as her stream arced out through the flap in her boxers to trickle noisily into the toilet. Her heart was thrumming, she was hyper-vigilant as she tried to sense any warm spots forming around her butt or thighs, but there was nothing. It really was all just flowing through the fly, just like it was supposed to.

Just like before, Shelby had been so focused on whether or not she could accomplish her task that she failed to register how good it felt to pee until she’d already been going for a while. When that happened, when she noticed how the relief crashing into her and pulsing out of her made her feel as though she was floating, something odd happened; Tingles built up in the soles of her feet, moving up her legs and through her spine. They felt really, REALLY good, but they made her shudder for whatever reason, messing up her aim. Some of her urine spattered the rim of the bowl, and a she felt some slickness and warmth around the fly of the boxers.

Once the shiver had stopped, her stream began to wind itself down. That weird, inexplicable trembling had already made her mess up a little. She hoped that her pee losing its force and speed wouldn’t do any more damage. She pushed down hard, and was able to mostly get the end of her release into the toilet, but the last few little drips ended up gliding down her legs.

She stepped back and looked down at herself. Only the tiniest little dark patch was visible over the crotch of her boxers. It felt clammy and cold now, but it was so small she was sure it would dry and fade quickly.

Emmett, whom had left the room as his bladder could no longer bear the sound of the faucet and of his sister peeing, returned. First, he looked at her and the floor surrounding the toilet. Both appeared dry. Good thing, too. One bathroom having an evil spider and the other having a drenched floor would leave Emmett with nowhere to pee for quite a while.

“See?” Shelby asked. “Told you I could do it.”

“Yeah,” Emmett said. “Um… I need privacy now, please?”

“You do?” Shelby asked, making no move to leave. “But, you were just asking to pee right next to me a minute ago, weren’t you?”

“Shelby, please?” Emmett begged, his upper body twisting about as he stomped his feet against the floor. “You can tease me all you want after I’m finished, I promise!”

“Okay,” Shelby said. “If you really mean that. But, if you—“

“Please!?”

“Alright, alright…” Shelby laughed, exiting the room finally. As she walked down the hall, she heard Emmett hurriedly yanking down his zipper, this noise was abruptly followed by a quiet trickling and a sigh. Shelby wondered if the addition of pants on top of the boxers would present any extra challenge for her at all.

As it turned out, she would discover the answer to her question later that evening.

Dad came home to pick Shelby and Emmett up and bring them to his office’s party. The drive there was long, and all that water still had yet to finish filtering through Shelby’s system. As a result, by the time they arrived her bladder was once more filled to its brim and hard as a rock.

Getting out of the car resulted in ripples of painful need to shudder through her. Her knees rubbed together and her thighs tensed. She didn’t come to her Dad’s office THAT often, but she was pretty sure she remembered where the bathrooms were. They would definitely have to be her first stop.

Dad led Shelby and her brother into the building, Shelby struggling to keep up with even his slow pace. Every few steps, she’d need to come to a stop and tense up her legs when she felt droplets of pee starting to bead at her opening.

The main lobby of the office building was pretty crowded for the party. At her short height, Shelby struggled to see the restroom signs overtop of everyone else’s heads. She bounced on her feet as she tried to remember if the toilets on this floor were located to the left or the right…

Before Shelby could spot the restrooms, Dad had asked her and Emmett to follow him up to his floor. It was embarrassing, but Shelby wasn’t so sure if she could hold it all the way up there… “I really have to pee,” she said.

“I’ll show you where the bathroom is once we’re up there,” Dad said. “Hold on a minute.”

Shelby didn’t think she had very many minutes left to hold on… Her bladder felt downright swollen and when they got into the elevator, she was forced to unfasten the button on her jeans, it had been digging into her middle like a sharp claw… As the elevator moved, Shelby felt dread filling her up in all the areas that weren’t already bogged down with pee. What if this thing got stuck? She’d wet her pants for sure…

She rocked from side to side, stepped in place, and tugged at her hair as she begged the elevator to NOT get stuck and to please, please move faster!

Finally, the doors slid open and Shelby hobbled out. To her dismay, Dad immediately started taking her and Emmett in the direction of his office. “Dad, I REALLY have to go,” she reminded.

“I wanted to make sure you said hello to everyo—“

“Dad, please?” Shelby begged. “I can say hi after…”

“Okay, okay…” Dad pointed off to one side, “They’re right down there,” he said. “Try to hurry.”

Eagerly, Shelby took off in that direction, her bladder already going light and loose with the knowledge that relief was finally approaching. Moments later, her bladder painfully twisted and cramped when she saw the line pouring out the women’s room door. There was zero line whatsoever for the men’s, of course.

The presence of urinals really made it so much faster to go in, pee, and leave. They took up less space, so that meant there were usually more places to pee inside a men’s restroom than a women’s since the rooms were generally still the same size. Shelby thought women’s bathrooms should have been bigger, that would be more fair.

Or, they could put a few urinals in them… Sure, the majority of girls couldn’t stand to pee, or didn’t know how. But, the urinals would at least be a nice option for the ones like her who COULD do it!

 Shelby reluctantly joined the line, rocking back and forth on her feet and occasionally cupping herself when she was hit by a particularly strong pulse from her bladder. The organ was a bit worn out, having been filled to its brim so many times today. Maybe she should have tried experimenting with the boxers on a day where she wouldn’t have to go anywhere; A day where she could stay at home until all the water she’d chugged had been filtered out without having to worry about waiting in a stupidly long line.

Shelby jiggled up and down, not caring if anyone noticed her emergency. Part of her was hoping one of the women ahead of her WOULD pick up on the fact she was bursting. Maybe then they’d take pity on her and let her cut…

The person directly in front of her turned and asked if she was having an emergency. But, when Shelby nodded, the other woman just turned back around, not alleviating Shelby’s wait-time in the slightest.

Shelby crossed her legs together tightly, tucked her hands between them, and tried to ignore the buckets of cold sweat going down her back. Everyone ahead of her should just let her cut, she’d be done SO fast! She wouldn’t have to take anything off first! Wouldn’t have to turn around and sit! Hell, she could even shave off a few more seconds since she didn’t necessarily need to shut and lock the stall door; she’d be facing away from everybody else, and nothing would be exposed!

She squeezed her eyes shut as her aching bladder begged her to stop visualizing her upcoming pee-break so vividly. Clearly, it wasn’t going to come any time soon… She tried to think of something else. She tried thinking about video games for a while. Somehow though, her mind flew off on a tangent regarding Super Mario 64; Specifically, the need to collect golden stars from various levels in order to unlock different rooms inside the castle. At the start of the game, pretty much all the rooms were blocked off, just one available… So, what if Mario had come in really desperate to pee, but he needed to find a ridiculous amount of stars to get the bathroom open?

‘Shelby, that’s dumb,” she told herself. ‘I don’t think Mario even HAS a bladder. And if he did, he could just go on a tree outside the castle— Oh, but Lakitu’s following him around with a camera the entire time, so he probably wouldn’t wanna— Gah, stop thinking about this!’

 Shelby took a few steps forward, her bladder throbbing harshly each time she set her foot down. She felt like she’d been here for HOURS, but the line had barely even moved! She was going to explode if she didn’t magically teleport to the front soon! ‘Don’t think about it, don’t think about it, don’t think about it…’ she begged, but her brain wouldn’t listen.

‘Well, even if Mario’s being followed by a camera, he can jump in the water and pee th— WHY AM I THINKING ABOUT THIS!? KNOCK IT OFF! God, think about— About Pokemon. Name them, alright? Bulbasaur, Ivysaur, Venusaur, Charmand— I wonder if anybody’s ever seen just the top of an Ivysaur in the woods and mistaken it for a bush and— NO. HELL NO. STOP. I don’t wanna picture that, I don’t—’ But, it was too late. Shelby hated her imagination sometimes.

Shelby glanced back up from her shifting feet to find the line hadn’t budged at all since she’d last checked. Seeing as how trying to think of different topics as a distraction had crashed and burned, she tried instead to think about nothing at all. Clearing her head of all thoughts proved impossible, though. Her brain was as full of unwanted, piss-related imagery as her bladder was of unwanted, actual piss.

The line finally inched forward, and when Shelby moved to catch up, a sharp trickle of pee escaped. She felt the material beneath her hands grow warm and damp, and all at once she realized she had very little chance of making it through this line.

Again, she looked at the men’s room, still totally devoid of any line. She seethed at the unfairness of it all. As if God wanted to taunt her, she was forced to watch as a guy easily strode into the bathroom, and the re-emerged about a minute later with a nice, empty bladder.

That was it. She couldn’t do this anymore. Shelby left the line and stumbled haphazardly towards the men’s room. She stopped just beside the door. What if somebody was in there? She couldn’t remember seeing anyone go in that hadn’t come back out, but still… And what if someone CAME in before she was done?

If she tucked most of her hair up inside her hat, she could maybe pass for a really feminine looking guy. If it weren’t for her breasts, anyway. They weren’t huge or anything, but they were very clearly THERE. She was pretty sure she was too skinny for anyone to think they were man-boobs. But, at the urinal, her back was going to be facing everyone… Unless someone was stood right beside her. Did… Did guys ever look at each other at the urinals? Even just by accident? She was sure that from just a casual glance, everything would look normal. Someone standing at a urinal with their fly down, peeing. But, then if they looked for LONGER than a second, they’d realize something wasn’t normal at all…

Hopefully, there would be a stall she could use instead. Less chance of drama that way. She’d keep her head down, RUN to the stall as fast as she could and lock herself in there. Then she’d pee, and if no one came in during that time she’d leave as quickly as possible. There wouldn’t be time to wash her hands, out there in the open where she was easily spotted, but that would be okay… She just wouldn’t tell her hygiene-inclined brother. Or maybe she would, before tousling his hair. He surely make a ridiculous noise if she did that.

Shelby pushed a bit of her hair up into her cap and then opened the door. She walked quickly on stiff legs, staring at the floor. She was moving too fast for her bladder, and it punished her with an intense, violent spasm and more than a few tiny leaks, but finally she’d reached the two stalls.

Which were both occupied.

Still staring at the floor, she could see the guys inside had their pants pulled down all the way and were sitting, which she assumed meant they were going to be there for a while. Her gaze shifted to the row of totally vacant urinals. She could use them… And she COULDN’T wait until one of those guys left a stall. It would take too long for her leaky bladder to handle, and when the guy opened the door he’d SEE her from the front, he’d see her chest, he’d see that she was a girl and that could cause a scene she didn’t want to be part of.

On the other hand, if she used a urinal, she’d get to pee NOW and even if someone left a stall or entered the room before she’d finished, they’d only see her back. With her hair hidden, and her baggier jeans not making her hips too pronounced, she was confident she could pass for a guy from behind. Especially if she was clearly pissing into a urinal, doing something that most girls couldn’t do.

Her decision made, Shelby walked towards the urinals. Her bladder shook and grew heavier with every step, she could feel more dampness collecting between her thighs. ‘If anybody DOES notice, just tell them how you had no choice. You NEED to do this, or you’re gonna have an accident.’

Once she was at a urinal, she pulled down her zipper, feeling more than a little trepidation. She hadn’t practiced shooting her stream through the boxers AND her pants yet. And this was only her second time doing the latter. Bursting at the seams while in public were far from the ideal circumstances to be getting more practice.

Her bladder seared and pulsed and one more squirt of pee exited her body. She cringed, against her will she remembered the day she’d wet herself after school. Peeing herself in girls’ underwear felt different than peeing herself in boxers. It was starting to go down her legs right away, wasn’t soaking her butt as much…

Shelby knew she was going to need all the space she could get, so she pulled the flaps of her jeans apart as far as possible. She parted the flap in the boxers and used one hand to keep it open as she put the other one in position to aim.

But, just like earlier at home, she found it very difficult to start her stream. She kept imagining this going horribly wrong. She had never tried to pee with her jeans still up before! If she messed it up, then what?! She’d have to go find her Dad while still wearing her wet pants and ask to be taken home. He’d definitely ask what had happened, and she wouldn’t be able to tell him the truth. She’d have to claim the line had been too long and she’d peed herself before reaching the front of it.

‘That’s not going to happen,’ Shelby tried to assure herself. ‘You’ve peed standing up tons of times before. It’s only a little different now.’ For a second, she considered just pulling her pants down out of the way, but the idea of having her butt on display like that kept her from doing it.

‘Relax…’ She urged her body. Her bladder was convulsing like mad at the sight of the urinal. Even if she’d only relieved herself into one a few times, it KNEW that this was a place for it to empty.

She cringed and rocked from side to side as her body continued to stubbornly hold back. ‘Please, come on…’ Her nerves were sky high. She could feel some of her hair falling back out of her cap, but she made no move to correct it. She told herself that the worst case scenario was that someone noticed and thought she was a long haired guy whose bladder had a case of stage fright. ‘Calm down… You just gotta pee.’

This lock-up thing BARELY ever happened to her! Twice in one day was inexcusable! Even given the unusual circumstances! She took in several deep breaths, but her pee remained imprisoned with her painfully full bladder. How could she need to go THIS bad and be struggling so hard to make it come out?!

A toilet in one of the stalls, and as the water rushed down the building’s pipes, liquid rushed down Shelby’s pipes as well. Her stream trickled forth, some of it wetting her jeans slightly as it wasn’t coming out strongly enough. Panicked, she pushed down hard, prompting her pee to spray and arc forwards like it was meant to. Now, it was safely hissing into the urinal, and Shelby sighed.

She heard the stall open and the guy walk out. She did her best to block out the sounds of his footsteps as he went to the sink… And why did the sink have to be so close to the urinals? If he turned his head to the right, he’d be looking at her! Anxiety grew, and as her stress built, her stream shrank. Panicked that it was about to get dribbly again, about to start running dripping into her clothes instead of blasting out into the urinal, she closed her eyes and gritted her teeth to keep it coming out fast and powerfully. She was pissing so hard that the guy at the sink could definitely hear it clearly, even over the faucet. It was no doubt obvious to him that whoever was using the urinal right now had been utterly desperate to go.

Rather than embarrassed, Shelby felt sort of proud. It was a little impressive that she’d held so much in that her release overpowered the noise of a faucet.

The man finally left the room and Shelby relaxed further, beginning to really enjoy this. She’d NEEDED this so badly, and the amount of rules she was breaking at the moment made it all feel pretty thrilling. She wasn’t supposed to be in a men’s room, but she was. She wasn’t supposed to use a urinal, but she was. She wasn’t supposed to pee like a boy, but she was. And she wasn’t supposed to urinate without pulling her pants down, yet she WAS. It felt good, it felt fun, it felt like such a great relief that her legs were tingling.

Then, she heard the door to the room open and shut, followed by footsteps. She tried not to panic. She just wanted to focus on how good it felt to let go. Most likely, whoever came in would just pay attention to handling their own need too. She looked just like anyone else peeing into a urinal, no reason for anybody to—

“Shelby?” the word came out utterly gobsmacked, and was spoken in a voice Shelby recognized immediately.

‘Shitshitshitshitshit…’ Shelby’s brain screamed. Miraculously, instead of slowing it down, the rush of adrenaline flooding her veins only made Shelby’s stream increase in speed and intensity. This was both good and bad. Good, because it meant it was still landing where she wanted it to. Bad, because it meant she’d FINISH faster and would have to turn around and face…

Abruptly, her pee stopped. She was empty. She’d managed to keep the necessary momentum and force going until the very end, the last few drops didn’t roll down her legs this time… But, she didn’t have time to celebrate that victory. “D—Dad…?” Shelby said as she turned around, zipping up her pants clumsily.

Her Dad was staring down around her waist, and she looked there too. There was a barely noticeable damp spot beside her zip, the result of those few errant spurts she hadn’t controlled so well when she’d first begun to pee.

“I…” Dad opened his mouth, then shut it again, clearly having no idea what he wanted to say.

“Um…” Shelby inched towards the door. She wanted out of this room as fast as possible, but running would only delay the inevitable. “The, uh, the line for the girls’ was way too long. I couldn’t hold it,” she explained, knowing that her statement WASN’T answering the main question her Dad had. Her response would have flown if she’d been caught coming out of a stall here, but that wasn’t what she’d been doing.

“Shelby, I… Did you… I mean…” Dad looked down at the floor below the urinals. “Not any grosser than usual down there…” Though, he shouldn’t have expected any different. Shelby’s clothes were nice and dry, save for the aftermath of the leaks she’d let out while holding it. And, he’d been able to hear pee hitting a urinal, it had ended up in the proper place… He just didn’t understand HOW. “I…” he ran a hand through his hair, making Shelby realize he felt as awkward and embarrassed by this as she did. “We’ll talk about this later. Go wait in the hall.”

Shelby left the room quietly. That had been so embarrassing! Of course, the person who walked in on her had to be the ONE person that would notice something was unusual right away!

Dad left the restroom a couple minutes later, he began walking down the hall in the opposite direction from his office. Shelby figured she was meant to follow him.

“You… Used a urinal,” Dad stated. “Like a man. Successfully.”

Shelby nodded. “I couldn’t hold it,” she reiterated. “There was nowhere else to go, and I had to so bad, and I didn’t have a ch—“

“Do you… Do that often?”

“Well, no. There aren’t urinals in women’s bathrooms.”

“That’s not… I meant, do you pee standing up very often?”

“Yeah,” Shelby admitted. “It’s fun. And, if I CAN do it, why shouldn’t I?”

“I suppose it doesn’t hurt anyone…” Dad said. “You do this at home?”

“Yeah, most of the time,” Shelby said. “Only time I don’t is if I’m too tired, or if I’m at school and somebody might notice and make a big deal about it.”

“Haven’t noticed any… Messes on the floor at home,” Dad said. “I don’t know HOW, but I guess this is something you’re just able to do… But, um… Is there a reason for it?”

Shelby shrugged, “First I just wanted to see if I could, then I thought it was fun, so I kept doing it. And it’s easier than having to always find a toilet I don’t mind sitting on, or mess with squatting down.”

“And, that’s all it is?” Dad asked. “You just do this because it’s fun and convenient for you?”

“Well, yeah,” Shelby said. “Like, today. I probably would have had an accident if I couldn’t use the urinal.”

“Nothing else?”

Shelby was confused now. “Um… What else WOULD it be?”

“I… I guess what I’m asking is; Do you think you’d be happier if you were a man?”

Ohhhh. Shelby laughed, surprised he thought she was going through something so serious just because of this. “No,” she said.

“Because if it IS something like that, I won’t be angry. I wouldn’t mind if it turns out I have two sons. I’d support you and help you be more comfortable, and—“

“It’s not that. I like being a girl, I just also like standing to pee. That’s all.”

“Alright,” Dad said. “Sorry I reacted so strongly. I just… REALLY did not expect to see that.”

“It’s okay,” Shelby said. “It was sorta embarrassing having YOU catch me doing that, but that’s all.”
