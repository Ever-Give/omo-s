As the train ride continued, Dwight’s relief faded and became replaced with more of the concern he’d been feeling for Kenneth earlier. Dwight had needed to pee so badly before, the awful aching pangs and bright hot twinges pulsing through his most sensitive spots were some of the worst things he’d ever experienced. The sight of his belly rounding out and hardening from how full his bladder was getting had been frightening.

But, Kenneth got those agonizing looking swells all of the time— And they were always a lot BIGGER than what Dwight had just seen inside his own body. Kenneth was a little thinner than him, true, but the prominent bulge that often formed in Kenneth’s center was much too pronounced for that to be the only reason it appeared so big. The round protrusion that appeared between Kenneth’s hips had always freaked Dwight out quite a bit, and now that he was aware of what it felt like to hold in his pee when it was only BEGINNING to pull his skin taut, it was REALLY stressing him out to imagine what Kenneth must have to go through.

By the time they finally arrived back at their barrack, Kenneth actually DID need to pee very badly. With some trepidation, Dwight forced himself to look at Kenneth’s midsection as the other hurried into the restroom. He was utterly swollen, and the sharp ball beneath his skin looked hard as a rock, like he’d swallowed down a boulder. Dwight wondered how Kenneth had any space left inside of his body for any of his other vital organs. His bladder ought to have been forcing them all aside to make room for itself.

Dwight’s heart sank. Kenneth appeared to be carrying an enormous weight, so heavy that it was surely a miracle he could even still walk. Dwight wouldn’t be surprised if, if he were to weigh Kenneth before and after he relieved his bladder someday, the poor thing would lose a few pounds just by peeing.

It wasn’t healthy. It couldn’t have been healthy. But, Kenneth endured this all of the time.

He heard Kenneth unzipping, followed by a torrent flooding into the toilet as he moaned in pleasure. Dwight turned his head slightly, watching his friend tremble and shiver with relief. “I… I offered to help you go at the station…” Dwight reminded. “You didn’t have to wait until we were all the way back HERE to—“

“I didn’t have to go that much then…” Kenneth murmured, paying close attention to his aim as several hours’ worth of liquid pressure expelled itself forcefully from his tip. He felt so floaty now, he was worried his jelly-like legs would give out and he’d end up spraying his piss all over the place. “And… Ahhhh… I feel fine now. So, don’t worry.”

Dwight DID worry, confusion making him shake his head. Kenneth had definitely needed to go at the train station. He could remember his friend chewing on his hand, even if he wasn’t doing much squirming. And, the typhoon he was releasing NOW was a clear sign he’d been holding it in for a while. He couldn’t understand why Kenneth had decided to wait when it had predictably resulted in him having a painful emergency.

Kenneth at last finished draining himself and zipped up his pants with another massive sigh. “Hahhh, finally…”

But, it hadn’t needed to BE ‘finally’! He could have gone over an hour ago at the station and been fine! “Kenneth, I don’t… You didn’t have to hold it for so long.”

Kenneth washed off his hands. “I’m okay,” he assured. “It was only JUST starting to really hurt about ten minutes ago, and I knew we were super close and it was going to be over soon, so it wasn’t even a big deal.”

That wasn’t reassuring! It shouldn’t have been hurting at all! “But, you could have just gone at the train station and not felt ANY pain whatsoever!”

“I only kind of needed it at the station,” Kenneth said. “I knew that I could wait.”

“Kenneth, you don’t…” Dwight ran a hand through his hair, trying to think of how to phrase this. He wasn’t always the best with words, he knew he was slower than his friends, knew he wasn’t as smart… He didn’t want to add to Kenneth’s self-consciousness, but his friend was seriously abusing his body for no decent reason. “You know it’s okay to pee when it ISN’T an emergency, don’t you?”

“I always relieve myself before I leave the barrack, just in case I’m out for a long time and there’s nowhere I can relax,” Kenneth shrugged. “Even if I don’t have to go that bad.”

“Could you… Maybe try to do that MORE often?” Dwight asked. “Peeing when you AREN’T about to burst, and not JUST when you’re getting ready to leave here?”

Kenneth knew that would probably be a good idea. It wasn’t like he’d enjoyed holding his bladder until it ached today. As soon as the desperate surges had begun, he knew it would have been better if he’d just gone at the train station like Dwight had offered. But, WHEN Dwight had offered that to him, he’d felt only a sharp, fluttery tingle in his abdomen and knew he just had a LITTLE pee inside his bladder— That he’d be done urinating in under a minute. That it would be a waste of time to make Dwight help him and have Bryce wait around for them when it WASN’T an absolute necessity for him to empty his bladder.

At the same time, he also KNEW that Dwight wouldn’t be aggravated if Kenneth didn’t take a super long pee, and that Bryce wouldn’t scold them for wasting time now that he’d begun to make ‘Kenneth’s health’ into one of his top concerns. But, for whatever reason, Kenneth was unable to free himself from the notion that he was only supposed to urinate when he absolutely could NOT avoid doing so for one minute longer.

He recognized that this belief came from his Father, and that basically everything his Father had ever taught him was completely wrong and didn’t deserve to be listened to. He just wound up obeying Father’s ‘rules’ so often that sometimes he didn’t even realize that these imaginary protocols had originated from that man.

He thought back to earlier on the train, how he’d noticed for the first time that it seriously HURT to bite his hands, and that the only reason he’d never realized that before was because the pounding in his bladder usually demanded the entirety of his attention. He knew that it wasn’t normal to always need to urinate so urgently that all other discomforts failed to register to him. He knew that it wasn’t healthy…

“W—We have tomorrow off,” Kenneth said. “I’ll try and… And go more often. A—As soon as I feel like I’ve got to.”

“That would make me feel a lot better,” Dwight said. “And, it should make YOU feel better, too.”

So, the next day, Kenneth woke up and relieved himself just like he always did. This wasn’t challenging for him at all. He always needed to go pretty badly when he got up, a buzzing tension pulsing out from within his center, flaring sharply down his length. He pulled himself free of his pajamas and relaxed his taut muscles, a night’s worth of urine gushing freely. He felt his insides slowly deflate as he moaned.

He and Dwight stayed inside that day to relax. They read, they talked, they listened to the radio. And, eventually, Kenneth felt the first twinges in his bladder. He allowed them to grow for a little bit, but once he felt a more consistent, tingly hum beneath his waistband, he thought that MAYBE this was when any other person would start heading to the restroom.

“G—Gonna… Gonna try…” Kenneth mumbled out softly to Dwight, standing and walking to the bathroom with some trepidation. THIS was a LOT trickier. He unzipped and aimed, and everything just stopped there. His bladder spasmed, muscles going taut with confusion. His body was stunned that he was telling it to empty so soon.

It wasn’t QUITE the feeling he got when he was so anxious that he couldn’t go. There was a hint of anxiety in his chest, the memories of Father screaming at him that he “Barely even had to go!” And had been “Complaining for now reason and wasting everyone’s time!” But, there wasn’t that ‘plugged’ feeling around his sphincters that he usually got. He didn’t feel the pressure slamming at his gate, begging for that last impenetrable barrier to slide open as it continued to remain a rock solid obstacle.

Instead, it was more like his body just didn’t know what to do…? His holding muscles weren’t tightening themselves up with stubborn fear, they were just… Not responding at all. He was locked up again, just in a different way. His mental state wasn’t the main crux of the issue, THIS seemed to be more physical.

Like he’d only urinated when at the breaking point SO many times and for SO long that now his body genuinely couldn’t DO it unless the pressure was severe enough.

He gave up, returned to his bed and laid against Dwight.

Dwight had not heard any trickling in the restroom, so he knew that Kenneth hadn’t been able to go. “Kenneth, are—“

“I couldn’t go,” Kenneth said. “I’ll wait a little more.”

Dwight shook his head. He needed to train Kenneth OUT of this. “Okay, let’s try it WITH me the first time?” He offered.

“You don’t have t—“

“I want to,” Dwight insisted, taking Kenneth back to the restroom.

Kenneth unzipped once more. “I d—don’t even know if… if our usual… ‘thing’ will work. I’m not feeling super anxious when I’m trying to go, it’s more like something INSIDE me seriously just isn’t WORKING.”

Dwight quickly came to the same conclusion Kenneth had— That his bladder had been put through so much abuse it didn’t function quite right anymore. “O—Okay… Er… Let’s try something different. Just… Take a deep breath, and hold it for a second before you let it out? Keep doing that for a bit?”

Kenneth gave this a shot. After several long, slow inhales and exhales, the walls of his bladder finally squeezed in and his stream flowed out. A thick, strong jet that carried on for half a minute.

Dwight’s heart sank at the force of Kenneth’s piss, and the duration it lasted for. Half a minute of a full-strength gush… When Dwight pissed that much he’d been close to the LIMIT. But, this was Kenneth’s ‘I’m only just starting to feel it!’ pee?

It was with a heavy heart that Dwight realized Kenneth must have had ZERO idea what an ‘average’ pee was like.

The next time Kenneth felt the urge to relieve himself, he got up right away. It took him a few minutes of the breathing exercise to get it out, but he finally did. This continued to work throughout the rest of the day, and by the end of it, Kenneth was able to manage his task without Dwight being in the room with him or right outside the door.

In just one day, it had gotten so much easier!

Granted, it was just one day that he’d spent entirely in his safe room, alongside the person he trusted most in the entire world.

He could… Probably do it in other places too, right? AND all by himself? He’d relieved himself in public places without Dwight’s (Or Bryce’s) assistance before— True, he’d been bursting at the seams THOSE times, but now that he knew how much the breath-holding thing helped him, he could probably do it in the right places even if he WASN’T exploding?

He really wanted to be able to do that. The very idea of being able to relieve himself totally on his own when he didn’t even totally NEED to— Merely WANTED to in order to get rid of a mild, irritating discomfort— sounded like a dream.

Kenneth could test himself soon. His break would continue into tomorrow, whereas Dwight would have to work. Kenneth could go into town and give himself a few trial-runs at the places he knew he could go— The bath-house and that one shop with the super private stalls. If he could manage to use either one of those spots totally alone and without it being an emergency, he’d know for SURE that he’d made major progress.

The next day, he told Dwight about his plan. Dwight didn’t seem very enthused by it. He nibbled on his lip. “Um… If you want to try that…”

“What’s wrong?” Kenneth asked.

“I’m just… I’m worried it might be too soon to try a ‘test’ like that? We only JUST figured out how to make it work in HERE while we’re together. I don’t want you to push yourself and then… I just think it would be better if you waited to try this later.”

“I won’t hurt myself,” Kenneth insisted. “If it doesn’t work, and I end up holding it too long, I’ll come back here. It won’t be a problem.”

“Well, I wish you’d do this on a day I can go WITH you,” Dwight said. “Not even just to help, just to— To keep an eye on—“

“I don’t need to be monitored,” Kenneth interrupted, and Dwight cringed at the edge of sharpness in his tone. “I’ve gone into town by myself before, and I’ve been able to relieve myself then!”

Dwight knew that his friend had, in fact, had success on solo trips before— But, the ‘success’ had been him hiding inside of a public shower stall until his completely filled bladder finally surrendered to the sound and feeling of the running water. Dwight didn’t WANT Kenneth to spend his day doing something similar, holding it until he basically exploded.

But, he also realized that he was thinking it was just a foregone conclusion that Kenneth WOULDN’T be able to urinate before his desperation reached that level. No wonder Kenneth was starting to sound so frustrated— Dwight wasn’t showing any confidence in him. And that was because Dwight didn’t FEEL confident about this, he didn’t think Kenneth could manage this by himself. But, not at least ACTING like he believed Kenneth could handle his challenge today wasn’t going to be helpful. How could Kenneth heal if his biggest supporter was having a hard time thinking he was CAPABLE of it?

So, even though he was still certain that this was too big of a step to take all at once, Dwight made himself nod, and told Kenneth; “I’m sure you’ll take great care of yourself today! But, if you have trouble, hurry back here.”

Kenneth agreed, and Dwight anxiously watched as he left the barrack. He hoped Kenneth would be okay… It wasn’t even JUST that he was nervous Kenneth wouldn’t be able to empty himself and would experience pain. It was because, after so much success yesterday, Kenneth was displaying more confidence about his ability to handle his problem. If his experiment today didn’t end up working, it could UNDO all of that fresh progress. Kenneth would be back to thinking he was broken, and that his problem was insurmountable.

Dwight hoped Kenneth’s day would go alright…

***

Kenneth wandered through town, trying to think of what to do. He didn’t yet feel any urge to urinate. Ordinarily, if he paused and took stock of his body’s needs and found that his bladder still felt empty, this would be a massive relief; He’d know he still had a LOT of time left to get to his barrack before his insides began to knot up on themselves.

But, today, he had such a strange goal; He WANTED to need to pee while he was in public. Not a lot, but just a little bit, enough to test if the breathing thing would work outside of his room. He went to the cafe, and ordered a glass of his favorite orange soda. He drank it quickly, then actually had his glass re-filled. This was such a rare thing for him, he was OUTSIDE and deliberately drinking past the point where his throat actually felt quenched.

Normally, while he couldn’t bring himself to abstain from drinking altogether and endure the feelings of thirst, he would drink until he was satiated and then stop. Now, he was drinking even though there wasn’t any sand-papery dryness coating his esophagus, he was drinking because the soda tasted really, really good and he WANTED more of it.

If… If he ever managed to get over his problem, he’d be able to do things like this all of the time. He’d be like anyone else, taking in as much fluid as he needed, as much as he WANTED, without obsessing over where he was going to PUT all of it later on.

Today, he WAS still obsessing over that quite a bit. Tension cramped within his chest. What if he failed his test today? What if, instead of emptying his bladder right after he noticed he needed to, he just froze up like always and had to hold it and hold it and hold it? He was confident that eventually he WOULD be able to relieve himself here in town— Either at the bath-house or that one shop— But, would he manage to do that BEFORE he was having an emergency?

***

Dwight stood at his post beside Bryce. He anxiously shifted his weight around, unable to find a position where the sharp needles of his nervousness didn’t buzz so painfully through his veins. Bryce noticed his fidgeting right away and sighed; “Smith, did you neglect to relieve yourself this morning?”

Dwight shook his head. He’d used the restroom right after Kenneth had finished up in there. “I went.” He continued to shuffle his feet.

 Bryce stared down at the little tracks Dwight’s boots were leaving in the dirt. “… Do you need to go AGAIN?”

Another shake of the head. “Nope, I’m just nervous about Kenneth…”

Bryce looked away. He had forgotten Kenneth had a break today, but he HADN’T forgotten how those two tended to get when they were separated. He was pretty sure that, aside from sleeping and days like this when they had to be in two different locations, the longest Kenneth and Dwight had ever gone without speaking to one another was thirty minutes. But, he didn’t even know if THAT counted because they’d both been knocked unconscious the whole time.

They both got… Uncomfortable if they spent too much time apart. Bryce was simultaneously both jealous and worried by it. He knew the intense clinging couldn’t have been healthy, but the idea of having someone who just NEEDED to be near him during every possible moment sounded really nice.

Unsure what he was doing, Bryce spoke without processing his own words; “How about I be Kenneth for you today?”

“H—How would that even work?” Dwight asked.

“I…” Bryce trailed off. He had no idea how it would work. He hadn’t even known he’d been about to offer that until he suddenly just HAD. “I don’t know, I’ll just… I’ll be next to you all day— I mean, I was going to have to do that anyway, I guess… And I’ll talk to you about whatever inane nonsense you and Kenneth like to talk about. Then you can stop feeling lonely and stop jumping around like that.”

“I… I’d like that,” Dwight admitted. Of course, it wasn’t only the separation that was making him so antsy, it was the concern that Kenneth would hurt his bladder or damage his confidence today. Still, even if Kenneth hadn’t SAID he didn’t want Bryce to know about his plans for the day, Dwight could GUESS that they were meant to stay secret. And, it wouldn’t be SO bad to spend the day talking with Bryce again.

***

Half an hour after he left the cafe, Kenneth felt the first twinges from his bladder. His heart-rate increased. It was going to happen soon… He’d felt so READY for this during the morning, but now that he was finally hurtling towards the challenge with precious little time left to prepare, the trepidation had taken over.

If this didn’t work out, he had PLENTY of time to get back to his room before he had an emergency. But, then he’d just have to stay there for the rest of the day, ruminating on his failure. No one to talk to since Dwight would be at his post with Bryce. Then, when Dwight finally DID get back, Kenneth would have to confess what had happened. Dwight had been so proud of him last night, and had said today he was SURE Kenneth could take care of himself today! If Kenneth DIDN’T succeed, he’d not only be letting HIMSELF down, he’d be letting Dwight down, too.

Once the tingles in his bladder had increased into a serious humming, he was heading towards the glass sculpture shop. He made it there easily, and walked very calmly towards the restrooms located in the back. There were a few other customers there, looking at the sculptures. Even with their eyes trained on the products, Kenneth couldn’t manage to shake the feeling that they were actually watching HIM heading to the restroom— That they were all thinking about him peeing. His muscles started to stiffen, particularly in his legs, and his face and chest heated when he realized that NOW he was walking as if he needed to urinate extremely badly. NOW they were definitely all thinking about his bladder!

He entered the restroom and leaned against the door once he’d gotten it shut. He took a steadying breath, some calm returning to him now that he was in the silent, vacant room. He shut his eyes, searching for the rational part of his brain that he’d just misplaced. ‘Nobody out there is THAT interested in your need to relieve yourself. They weren’t staring, and you are being silly!’

Now feeling a little more steady, Kenneth made for one of the stalls. They looked just as secure as they had been the last time he was here. Each one more like its own private room, with a heavy, thick door that lacked any sort of gap. Totally private and safe. A place where he could urinate in total solitude just the way he liked.

He clicked the lock into place, his bladder starting to thrum a lot more now that he was looking at a toilet— His need going from ‘barely there’ to ‘I gotta go, but I can maybe ignore it.’ Nowhere near the point when he’d usually go, but that was the point today, wasn’t it?

He unzipped and aimed for the bowl. Nothing happened. It was the same confused, numb feeling he’d gotten yesterday; His body not comprehending that he was SERIOUSLY asking for it to pee already. He took in a long, slow breath and held it in his lungs for a moment before letting it out. He did it again. And again. And again. It wasn’t working as fast as it had been in his room…

He didn’t get discouraged yet. Of course, he’d have to do this LONGER in a different location. It was understandable— Expected, even! But, then he just HAD to remember all of the people out in the main part of the store. Every drop of rationality inside his brain seemed to pour out through his nose. Every drop of urine inside his bladder refused to pour out through his tip.

He’d been in here way too long. Anyone who’d seen him go in was probably wondering about it. No, they were DEFINITELY wondering about it. They were thinking ‘Oh, that guy sure looked like he had to pee a few minutes ago! Why isn’t he finished yet? He should have come out by now!’

Kenneth squeezed his eyes closed against the thoughts. They were ridiculous, pure and simple. NO ONE would pay that much attention to him! But, it was too late, the spiraling thoughts had begun, and he was trapped inside the destructive tornado of his anxiety. It whirled around within his chest and lungs, rendering him nearly incapable of breathing— Incapable of doing the special breathing exercise Dwight had taught to him.

It became clear that he wasn’t going to be able to do this— Not now, anyway. He really DIDN’T have to pee that much, just— Just a little more time, not enough that he was having an emergency, just enough to get him a LITTLE fuller. Then, he should be able to do it. Then he’d know he COULD do it.

***

Bryce wasn’t actually half-bad at pretending to be Kenneth. At first, his impression of the other man had been entirely mocking. He’d put on an exceptionally whiney voice and talked about palm trees in a way that made it sound as if he wanted to have sex with them. But, after some protests from Dwight, Bryce calmed it down and decided that the BEST way to act like Kenneth would be to simply be Dwight’s friend.

“You are still squirming,” Bryce pointed out. “Are you nervous, or do you need t—“

“Nervous,” Dwight admitted. “Kenneth is… Doing something today that I know will be difficult for him. So, I’m just worried.”

“Ah, well, I’m sure he will be fine,” Bryce said, since that was what a FRIEND would say. “And, even if it goes wrong…” He ran a hand through his hair. Something was going tight in his chest as he thought over his next words. “Well, you will be there for him, won’t you? You’re… You’re a good friend…”

“I will,” Dwight agreed.

Bryce’s stomach churned in the way it so often did when he was about to get sick, or when he was super stressed. There was something in his core— Or, rather, something WASN’T there. He had this vacant, gut-twisting hollow sensation inside of him. He felt like a fly caught underneath a glass cup, dying to join in on something he’d been cut off from.

Kenneth and Dwight had each other. They had always had each other. They WOULD always have each other. And Bryce was there on the side, a ‘replacement’ for either one of them when they couldn’t be together.

***

Kenneth had wandered through the town for another half hour before the thrumming in his midsection became so pronounced that he’d needed to tense his thighs up a couple of times. He could probably actually PEE now if he tried it again. Certain of his success, Kenneth turned and started in the direction of the sculpture shop.

He didn’t make it there.

He instead ran into one of the librarians on the street. She recognized him and mentioned that they had new books in, but that a few of them were too damaged to go up on the shelves. “If you want some of them, you can pick some out.”

Kenneth ignored the little flaring jolt from beneath his fly which asked him to please go use the restroom first. He didn’t need to go THAT much, this would give him some time to fill up more so that he’d have a better chance at success! Besides, maybe he could find something to read to Dwight.

So, instead of going to the shop and making a second attempt at finding relief, Kenneth followed the woman back to the library. Kenneth could see why she’d been reluctant to put a few of the books up on the shelves. They were pretty clearly in their final days and couldn’t survive much handling. If Kenneth took any of them, he would have to be super careful not to tear them up or allow their covers to fall off.

He found some romance stories and considered getting one of those for Dwight as a way to show how much he loved him. Predictably, ALL of the books featured a relationship between a man and a woman. Kenneth didn’t think he’d ever seen a book where two men were together in that way. He didn’t understand why. Sure, those relationships weren’t exactly allowed in real-life, but LOTS of things happened in books that weren’t allowed in real-life. Why were stories not allowed to cross that line, either? Was what he and Dwight doing so bad that it couldn’t even be WRITTEN about?

He ended up looking through some of the romance books anyway. He would picture the female lead as a man and try to figure out how different the story would have been if that were actually the case. It would still be about two people falling in love… Some things would be different, like maybe some of the characters’ friends would stop wanting to be their friends. And the book wouldn’t be able to end with a wedding, and there wouldn’t be any pregnancies mentioned in the epilogue… But, that would be all. So, why couldn’t there be a book where two men loved each other?

He gave up on the romances. None of them really reminded him of himself and Dwight, anyway. He found a different one that was about two friends who had been attached to one another since childhood, went through all of the trials and tribulations of life together and grew old by each other’s sides. Just by skimming the book, neither of the men ever ended up with wives, and just lived together instead. THIS one did make him think of Dwight, and how he’d love to spend the rest of his life with him. Everything about the book insisted this was just a story of friendship, not of romance, but the more Kenneth read from it, the less he was able to accept that the characters were meant to be friends and nothing more.

He ended up sitting in one of the chairs and reading through the entire thing. It was a very, very long story since it spanned across the men’s entire lives, but Kenneth had always been a fast reader. He had tears in his eyes towards the end when the first of the men succumbed to old age and his ‘friend’ was left feeling like the most vital part of himself had been torn away. He hoped that, when he read this part to Dwight, he wouldn’t end up crying in front of him.

He stood from the chair, and— Oh, GOD. His bladder’s contents sloshed HARD against his sphincters. How… How long had he been reading for?! How could he have possibly gotten SO focused that he didn’t realize how much worse his situation was getting?! Doubtless, his bladder had been searing for a WHILE, stretching out his midsection and forming into an uncomfortable boulder atop his hip-bones. Yet, it wasn’t until right NOW that he finally registered that he seriously needed to get himself to a freaking toilet!

He scrambled back to the librarian’s desk, holding up the book he intended to take with him. “I—I’m going to— Ah—“ His pupils were darting all around, panic mushing up his brain. When his gaze landed on a worn sci-fi book whose author’s name he recognized from something Bryce had said once, he picked it up. “Nnnh, this one too… I—“

The librarian watched him carefully, even with his lower body covered up by the desk, his bouncing couldn’t go unnoticed, and the tension on his face was blatant as well. “You really liked that book, huh?”

“Y—Yes…” Kenneth said. He’d liked it TOO much. Way, way too much… God, he needed to pee! He still couldn’t comprehend why it hadn’t struck him until right now! He could recall a scene IN the book where both of the characters relieved themselves in some desperation after a much too long carriage trip. He remembered that there had been quite a detailed description of the way their streams created a ‘fizzing puddle’. Surely THAT should have been enough to bring him back to the reality of his situation, right? Why hadn’t it?! “I—“

She lowered her voice. “The bathrooms are right in the back, if you didn’t know…”

“R—Right,” Kenneth said. He wanted to just run out the door and hurry to that shop to finally unload— There wasn’t any question now as to whether or not he was full enough to do it. But, while that action WOULD get him his relief a lot faster, it would also LOOK super strange if he left without going to the toilet first. The librarian, a person he only sort of knew, would wonder about him… ‘Why didn’t he go pee? It’s obvious he needs to! He must have a problem!’

Or, Kenneth’s rational side tried to reason, she’d just assume she was mistaken as to the meaning of his fidgeting and then not even think about it a minute later. Kenneth knew what he SHOULD do, he should IGNORE his self-conscious anxiety and get himself to that store before his bladder ruptured. He didn’t have much time left to waste!

His self-conscious anxiety won, though.

He nervously slinked to the restrooms in the back of the building, his bladder sloshing with each step like an overstuffed water balloon, making it very clear to him that every drop of soda he’d had today was stretching out his reservoir. Maybe though, just MAYBE, he would be able to go right HERE. Every step jostled his bladder to the point he had to fight very hard to keep the cringing wince from showing on his face.

He entered the stall and locked the door. This wasn’t like the stalls at the other shop; There were gaps here. A big one at the bottom that left his feet visible, and two on either side of the door, providing enough room for someone to peek in if they really wanted to. ‘WHO would want to?’ Kenneth asked himself. ‘And there’s no one even HERE. Just go!’ He unzipped with shaking hands and begged his bladder to please, please grant him some relief.

He HAD to go here, he HAD to prove that he was getting better— He WAS getting better! Yesterday had gone so well! But, maybe yesterday had just been a fluke. Maybe he wasn’t improving at all, and this situation he’d stupidly gotten himself into was going to prove that. He wouldn’t be able to pass his own self-imposed test, the one Dwight had said he was SURE he’d be able to manage! And, no way could he hide the failure from Dwight, by the time he got back to his room he’d be doubling over and whimpering, so obvious in his desperation. Dwight would be able to tell he’d been unsuccessful, Dwight would be so disappointed in him! He’d have let Dwight down…

He shook more and his chest tightened alongside his aching holding muscles. Despite being filled by a liquid, Kenneth’s bladder felt like it was as solid as a rock. A sharp, firm orb of pain and discomfort all squished up in his lower body, and one that he was desperate to rid himself of as its heavy contents pushed forcefully against the overburdened ring of muscles holding it at bay.

‘Please… Please…’ he thought. ‘I want to go…’ He began doing the breathing exercise again, and the more he did it, the worse his body hurt. His skin was being tugged unforgivingly against the boulder of his bladder. His middle throbbed, heat scorching and flaring throughout him, but nothing was making its way past the solid barrier his stress-level had created.

‘You have to…’ Kenneth fought back a moan of displeasure. ‘Dwight will be disappointed in you! He told you he was SURE you could do it, don’t prove him wrong!’ He bore down on the muscles in charge of his ‘nozzle’ with all his strength, pleading for the flow to begin. ‘Please, just a little bit?’ He begged himself. ‘Just enough that I can walk to the store easier?’

Nothing.

But then there was a drop!

A small, clear drop collected on his tip and it plinked down into the bowl a moment later. This was then replaced by a second drip, and then a third. A very slow, hesitant trickle was making its way free, and if it carried on like this, Kenneth voiding himself drop by tiny drop, he would probably be in here for over an hour before he got it all out of his system.

This wasn’t going to work! But, he was… He WAS going. Technically. Urine WAS exiting his body, so what he was doing now DID technically count as peeing. The drips didn’t make him feel relieved at all, if anything they were making the gnawing, heated agony chewing away at his bladder and urethral sphincter hurt even worse. Every drop stung on its way out, his scared muscles continuing to try and pull them back in spite of how desperately he wanted them to keep coming and pick up speed until they finally became an actual, real stream.

This wasn’t going to happen, and he bit his lip to hold back a whimper. Going purely by definition, Kenneth may have been urinating, but as far as he and the feelings in his body were actually concerned, he was still holding it. He still felt the painful, unrelenting, agonizing need to GO just as strongly as ever, the drops slowly falling into the toilet every several seconds not even enough to fill up a thimble.

He tried and tried, to lean IN to the very slight loosening of his hold that he’d managed to achieve. So often, he felt like an invisible, indestructible cork was plugging his pee-hole shut. Right now, it felt like the cork had been… moved a little bit to the side, enough for something to squeak out past it if it pushed hard enough. If only he could relax enough to dislodge the cork the rest of the way!

But, he kept thinking about how much he had to go, how badly he needed to at least SORT OF pass his test today, how desperately he DIDN’T want to have to tell Dwight he’d failed and disappoint him. And, the more he thought about it, the more the imaginary cork seemed to tighten, until he was no longer even managing those shuddering dribbles.

Frustrated and with his heart beating wildly, Kenneth stuffed his dick back into his pants. He wanted to be back in his room so bad… But, he didn’t want to see the look on Dwight’s face when he arrived there in this condition! He had to get this piss out of himself before he returned to his room, he had to be able to show Dwight— and HIMSELF— that yesterday hadn’t been a total fluke!

He’d just go to that store. He could pee at that store— He KNEW he could do that now! He left the restroom and started to shuffle for the library’s front door. Ohhh, he needed to go so badly! What he wouldn’t give to be able to TELEPORT to that store, lock himself into one of those safe stalls and let it all flow out in a warm, heavenly cascade of pure relief…

Unfortunately, Kenneth did not magically develop super-powers, so he still was going to have to walk. He had his hand on the door and was about to push it open when a tap to his shoulder made him jump. He knew some people, when faced with such severe desperation, would leak if they got startled like that. And, while he had done that a couple times himself, it was exceedingly rare. Instead, his bladder would cramp up catastrophically for a moment, sending unimaginable pressure down his length that was powerful enough to bring tears to his eyes. He’d feel like he was GOING to leak, he’d feel the urine pushing SO hard against him, but then it would stop, it would fizzle out, and he’d be left with a horrid, stinging agony instead of a moment or two of horrified, embarrassed relief before he controlled himself again.

It was the librarian that had stopped him. “Don’t forget your books,” she told him, handing them to him.

He took them in one shaking arm, trying in vain to control the motion of his legs. They wouldn’t listen to him. His feet kept jiggling, his knees kept rubbing, like his limbs had minds of their own and didn’t care how humiliated they were making him feel. “Th—Thank you…”

The librarian was LOOKING at his legs, and before he could even pray to the Heavens for her NOT to comment, she already did; “Um… Was the restroom locked? I swear I opened the doors this morni—“

“No,” Kenneth shook his head. “I got in, don’t worry, I just… I have to go right now!” He turned back to the door.

“A—Are you okay?” The librarian asked. And her voice was filled with so much concern, so much incomprehension, that something inside Kenneth snapped.

“I— I have— I have— I have— It’s like… I’ve got a condition, alright?” Kenneth confessed. Holy fuck… He didn’t even know this woman’s NAME and yet he was actually… He was talking about ‘IT’ with her. He was talking about his most embarrassing and most vicious nemesis. What in God’s name was he doing? What was he thinking?!

“You’re sick?”

“N—No— Yes— I— I don’t know!” Kenneth said. “I just— It’s not easy for me to… Relieve myself. Around other people, or in unfamiliar places, or if it’s not private enough, or just… I have to feel a certain way, or it doesn’t come out… And, I went out today to try to do something that I thought would help me fix the problem, but I made a mistake and now—“

“Oh…” She was obviously shocked that he’d decided to confess this to her. “I didn’t mean to pry…”

“I—It’s fine…” Kenneth said. Now that she knew, he gave in and gripped his crotch with his free hand, just to try and lessen the awful pangs of his need. “I have to go somewh—‘

“I want you to take one more book,” the librarian said. “Hold on.”

Kenneth hadn’t been that irritated with her before, but NOW he sure was. She KNEW he was having an emergency and that he had somewhere else that he very urgently had to get to. He didn’t have time for this… He had half a mind to just bolt out the door and forget about her, but a sudden wicked, painful spasm made him double over and root himself to his spot.

She returned and handed him a third book. He barely glanced at it as he tucked it under his arm, but he could tell it was a children’s picture book. He had no idea why she would want him to have that— Why she would want him to have it SO MUCH that she’d kept him from a desperately needed toilet for a few extra moments. Still, he choked out a “Thank you,” as he clumsily shoved his way outside.

He was surprised by how dark it was outdoors. How long had he been in there for? Dwight was probably finished with work for today, he was waiting in their room now, he was wondering where Kenneth was. He was probably worried. He probably thought something bad had happened. He probably thought Kenneth was struggling, having trouble, failing his test…

All the more reason to get to the store and unload his poor bladder!

He cursed and winced under his breath with each step. He felt like he was trying to carry an overflowing bucket. His bladder was so heavy, it was exhausting just to move it around… The store was close, though. It was so close, he just had to get there… He kept clutching his crotch with his free hand whenever he was out of the glow of the street-lamps. Not many people were out this late at night, but he’d just DIE if someone saw him holding himself!

He glanced down at the swell of his bladder protruding within his usual flat middle. It made sense the sight of this freaked Dwight out so much. A big lump on such a tiny frame was almost disturbing from how out of place it looked. Every drop felt like it was right at his gate now, tears beaded in the corners of his eyes. He needed to go so much he was fighting back the urge to start crying.

He made it to the store at last.

And saw that it was closed.

 No— No, please!— He picked up his pace, hoping that maybe someone was still inside. He’d knock on the door, beg them. He was so out of his mind that he would BEG, confess everything, confess that that restroom was the only one he knew he could USE and that he NEEDED to use it NOW.

He rushed to the door and began knocking, hopping from foot to foot and occasionally needing to press his hand BACK between his thighs No one came to the door. He crossed his legs and whimpered, tears flowing down his cheeks now. He didn’t care, he didn’t care. He just— He wanted it to stop.

His heart pounded as he tried to think of what he could do now. He couldn’t go back to his room like this. He didn’t even know if he’d make it there in time. Between here and his room, there would be many stretches where he’d have solitude at this time of the night. Without people, or the fear of people suddenly appearing, he’d be at just as much risk of an accident as anyone else.

And, even if he DID make it back dry, Dwight would SEE what he’d done to himself! He’d see the heavy knot of piss searing in his lower abdomen. He’d see the way he couldn’t let go of his dick for longer than a minute. He’d see the way his legs were tangling together, the bouncing and jiggling that he couldn’t help.

And he’d be disappointed. “Oh, you did so well yesterday…” he’d say, his face falling. And, he’d apologize to Kenneth, say that he should have INSISTED that he not try this, should have INSISTED that they do this together some other time instead. And… And Kenneth would feel so ashamed of himself. Even if Dwight managed to not let the disappointment show, Kenneth would still feel that way enough for the both of them. He’d feel like a failure.

He had to go to the bath-house now, hope that IT was still open. He could pee there, he’d done it before. It was a safe place for his bladder, and the walk wasn’t anywhere near as long as it would take to get to his room. He could make it. He just… He had to make it there!

As… As soon as he felt okay to walk again, anyway.

On a whim, he tried shifting and crossing his legs around in the OTHER direction, hoping that this would help him regain some of his strength.

It didn’t work.

Uncrossing his hold and shifting his weight took away some of the badly needed support from his bladder. The bright hot ball of tension was shaken up, the ocean trapped within it sloshed with enough force that his tears picked up speed. His poor sphincter was assailed by wave after wave of liquid that was just as desperate to flow out as Kenneth was to keep it in, and as the pressure reached a crescendo, Kenneth released a pained wail and snapped his thighs back together when a leak burst past his overburdened defenses.

Delirious, he stumbled into the darkened alley between this shop and the one beside it. In a flurry of motion, he got his belt apart, got his zipper down. He barely managed to keep the books beneath his arm as he yanked his dick free and aimed between his feet, breathing heavily and openly BEGGING. “Please… Please, I… I need it… Please…” Tears rolled down his face.

He was so stupid… He shouldn’t have even tried this. Or, at least, he shouldn’t have gotten so distracted reading a book that he managed to get himself THIS desperate after one of the only toilets he could use had been blocked off from him. He should have ignored the librarian, gone straight to the store, peed BEFORE it was an emergency like he was SUPPOSED to…

Now he was in agony, filled up with piss and even more filled up with shame. He WOULD burst before he got to his room, maybe not completely, but enough to soak him. He’d let Dwight down, he’d let himself down. He was so stupid, and he had to pee, and he couldn’t pee, and he just wanted to pee…

He squeezed his eyes closed, miserable, chest going hot. He tried to focus on the silence of the night. No one was out. It was too late. He was alone here, concealed by the shadows, nobody was around to see him…

Gentle pattering hit his ears, and then a quiet hiss. He opened his eyes, dreading that he would find it had started to rain. But, then he felt the looseness in his middle and his eyes went wide when he realized the only stream of water here was coming out of him. A nice, thin jet striking the wall and dampening it quickly.

Stunned, he panted out a loud sigh. “Ahhhhh….” His body shuddered as tension started to drop away. He murmured out another sigh, just as the door to the OTHER shop slammed open and a few men began loudly walking out, their footsteps quickly approaching.

And, everything stopped right away. Kenneth’s entire body welded itself shut instantaneously. His flood gates closed themselves tight, and he shoved his cock back into his pants, yanking his zipper up. His bladder forced one last protesting leak into his boxers as he hurried from the alleyway, his urethral opening stinging hard with every step.

He passed the three men just as THEY went into the alleyway, and barely managed to hold in the groan when he heard their zippers being pulled, the hiss of their streams hitting the wall HE’D just been using and would give ANYTHING to be able to KEEP using. He’d only managed to get out a cup’s worth of the ocean of water straining within him. He needed ALL of it out!

He was such a complete and total failure. He SHOULD have been able to finish. Anyone else would have been able to finish! Why did he do this to himself today!? He shouldn’t have bothered! He should have been able to predict it would have ended badly! He should have known better! He should have!

No matter how carefully he walked, he couldn’t escape from the fullness still radiating in his bladder, the impossible swell so prominent in his middle. Lightening the pressure was impossible. No matter how far he bended forwards, no matter how much he leaned back, no matter how slowly or quickly he moved, the pain was always there, front and center. Nothing made it better, but on the flip-side nothing seemed to be making it much WORSE anymore, either.

No way would the bath-house still be open now. He was screwed.

He had to get back to his room, likely half drenched when he managed to spill over a few times along the way. He had to confess to Dwight that this whole experiment had been a bust. He had to accept the defeat, the disappointment, the shame. He wasn’t getting better, he was just getting worse. Yesterday had been a rare miracle, lightning in a bottle, something that he’d never be able to recreate.

He turned out the street where the bath-house was. Sure enough, it appeared to be closed. His engorged bladder sloshed and wet heat blooming between his thighs made him break into a fevered sprint to the door anyway. He knocked on it frantically with one hand, fighting to hold onto his crotch AND the books with the other.

The door actually opened, and a woman was looking at him. “We’re closed for the ni—“

“I— I know!” Kenneth blurted out in a wide-eyed panic, his voice going shrill and high enough that it may have been able to shatter glass. “I just need a minute, please?!” He knew he probably looked insane. He would have kicked himself for this humiliating, debasing performance he couldn’t stop himself from putting on, but his legs were too busy being tied into a pretzel right now.

“Um…”

“I need to—“ Kenneth tried to steady his voice and calm back down, even though his heart was pounding and his bladder was screeching. “I need to— To please… To please use the facilities? Please?”

She stepped back into the building, “Er… Okay, I mean, I guess if it’s an emergency, that should be fine…”

“Thank you,” Kenneth managed, stepping inside after her. Tears dotted his cheeks, he squeezed away at the aching barrier separating his piss from the outside world. His pee-hole was BURNING from the strain now. His entire body felt weighted down, dying from the efforts as he forced his tense legs to keep propelling him forwards. He would go here. He HAD to go here… Oh, please, please, let him be able to go here…

He made it to the door of the men’s room. Oh, to lose himself to the blissful oblivion of relief as he stood below the spray of the shower…

Wait.

He… Couldn’t do it in the shower, could he? That employee would hear it come on and get suspicious, and would he then have to confess WHY he’d had to turn the shower on? Was it actually against the rules to urinate in the showers here? Would he be told not to come back? What would he do in the case of ANOTHER emergency, then?

No. He was going to have to make himself go in an ACTUAL toilet like a NORMAL person would.

But, that should be EASY. Yeah, it was a place he was unfamiliar with, but the bath-house was CLOSED. The only other person here was a woman, and even if part of her job WAS cleaning up in the men’s room, she wouldn’t come DO that when she knew he was in here USING it. That would be awkward for them BOTH even if Kenneth hadn’t been cursed with a shy bladder.

He looked over to the row of sinks lined up next to the urinals. He could… Maybe sort of RECREATE the shower in a way, too. Just… Turn on the sink, and put his hand beneath the water as he listened to it. That should get him peeing, right? Probably. He’d just have to really SCRAMBLE for one of the stalls on the other side of the room once it started to avoid getting himself too damp.

To make that easier, he unbuckled his belt and unzipped his pants as he approached the sink. He set the three books down on the counter and cranked it on, allowing the water a few seconds to warm up. The sound of it erupting into the basin sent his bladder rippling, and he crossed his legs together and jiggled. Then, he thrusted a hand beneath the flow and immediately his urgency sky-rocketed to the absolute worst thing he’d felt all day.

A whimper of pain tore through his throat as the pressure peaked and his urethra flared. He gripped his other hand around the counter, knuckles whitening as he tried NOT to let the hand drop do his dick and act as a dam that would prevent this plan from working entirely. He was dangling at the edge of his absolute limit now, everything inside him was utterly exhausted, and the imaginary cork he’d been fighting for so long started to crumble…

He was peeing, and before he registered that he released a moan, only aware that suddenly something had stopped hurting him so badly. But, then the heat and dampness struck him and he realized that he was GOING. His first instinct was to grind his thighs together and STOP, but this had been what he’d WANTED, if he made it stop, he would have to start over, and— And he just had to get to a toilet. But, the stalls were all the way on the other side of the room and he was peeing NOW, and— And, he was alone in here and nobody was around to come in, and—

He limped a few steps to the closest urinal, pulled his pissing dick free and gasped out a haggard groan as his stream was at last directed into the porcelain. “Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh….” His eyes went unfocused, vision going foggy and blurry as his mouth hung open with slack-jawed relief.

His eyes drooped shut as he lost himself to the bliss of it all. He’d held it for so long, had been in so much misery trying to get rid of all this pee, and now that he’d finally managed to make it come out, he could do nothing but submit himself to the pleasure that took away all his pain. His stream surged, his bladder shrank, his spine shuddered…

Ohhh, why did this have to feel so good? The sheer pleasure he always felt in these moments made his brain knot with confused conflicting thoughts. He HATED being pee-shy, he HATED how embarrassing and hurtful it was, he HATED how much it controlled his life and how he interacted with the world. But, this… He LOVED this… It was one of the best feelings in the world, just… Letting go, doing something so incredibly NEEDED, something so NATURAL and pleasurable…

His euphoria reached a new peak as his bladder finally lowered to half capacity, without realizing it he’d leaned forwards, supporting himself with one palm flat against the wall. Time moved in a strange way as his liquids continued to gush out of him. Minutes or seconds flowing just as easily as his urine.

It ended with his jetting stream slowing down and narrowing to a dribble that trickled lazily and prompted him to give a push to help it along. He finally felt like he was done, but then a few slow squirts spurted out of him and splashed into the urinal. At last, he was drained, but he stayed where he was a few seconds longer, worried more was to come.

Once he knew for sure he was empty, he stumbled back, zipped his pants, and put his belt back together. He washed off his hands and barely remembered to retrieve the books from the counter.

He left the restroom, feeling light and floaty. Amazing how much easier it was to walk without a full bladder! The woman was in the hallway, and he blushed as he walked past her. “Th—Thank you…” he said once more. “I’m r—really sorry.”

She waved him off, “It’s okay, I can tell you needed that a lot…”

Kenneth’s blush deepened and he picked up his pace. He resumed the walk back, now certain Dwight must have been even MORE worried about where he was and what had happened to him.

In between town and the area Kenneth guarded, there was a bit of a wooded area to walk through. Kenneth didn’t feel creeped out traversing it after dark, it was actually rather peaceful in the silent night. But, towards the end, he started to feel the need to pee once more, his bladder worn out from its earlier abuse.

He could… He could try it… If it didn’t work, he’d be in his room before he needed to go badly again. He turned to a tree, unzipped and aimed. He took the same steadying breaths Dwight had encouraged him to yesterday, focused on the tranquil solitude of the woods.

And he peed. It came out in a slow, halting stream that he had to REALLY push on to keep moving, but he peed. He peed for twenty seconds, and then he was already done… He hadn’t needed to go much at all— But he’d still gone. And, that was okay. That was good, even. Now, he knew he wouldn’t have anything MORE pressing to attend to when Dwight inevitably asked him where he’d been.

He made it back to his room and was immediately engulfed in a tight hug. “Kenneth, you’re okay!” Dwight cried, nuzzling his face against his neck.

“I told you, idiot,” said Bryce’s voice.

Bryce was just… Here. In their room. In Kenneth’s bed… Kenneth’s eyes popped open to stare. “What are y—“

“Dwight started to panic once the sun had gone down and you still weren’t back. He wanted me to help him look for you, but I said we should give it a little more time and that you’d be FINE. And, you are.”

Dwight scowled back at Bryce. “That’s not what happened! I told you I couldn’t find Kenneth, and YOU insisted on coming back here to wait with me because ‘There’s no way I can sleep if I don’t know he’s safe.’”

Bryce flopped onto his side and looked away. “Feh. Do you have any witnesses to back up this fable you’ve concocted?!”

“Well, yeah. There’s—“

“Paulson, where have you been?” Bryce interrupted sharply.

Kenneth didn’t want to explain the test to Bryce, and he certainly didn’t want to explain how spectacularly he’d failed it… “Um, well…” he remembered the books. “I was at the library,” he said. “I got some books they said I could keep— And I got this one for you!” He handed the sci-fi novel to Bryce.

Bryce stared at the cover. This was actually a very rare book, the first edition of his favorite author’s first book. It was in awful condition, but still… It was making Bryce feel extremely funny. It was a familiar kind of ‘funny’ now, but he didn’t think he’d ever actually get USED to it. “O—Oh… Thank you…” Heat scorched at the backs of his eyes, and he had no idea why, just that he needed to leave this room immediately before he started to… “G—Goodnight, you two, I’m gl—glad you are safe, Paulson…” He hurried out.

“I got this one for you,” Kenneth added, giving Dwight the ‘friendship’ book that didn’t seem to be about a ‘friendship’ at all. “I will read it to you, but it has a really sad part towards the end.”

“O—Oh,” Dwight said. “Er… Were you gone for so long because you were just reading this whole book?” If THAT was the case, he really HAD worried for no reason. That probably WAS all that happened. Kenneth certainly didn’t look like he was bursting to piss. He wasn’t squirming, his abdomen was flat. And he was dry, too, so he’d been able to relieve himself and he’d been able to do it PROPERLY.

“Um… That’s part of why I was gone for so long,” Kenneth admitted. “I… I didn’t… I don’t want to disappoint you…”

“Why would I be disappointed in you?”

“Because you said this morning that you were SURE I’d be able to pass the test,” Kenneth said. “And—“

“Hold on, I said I was SURE you’d take care of yourself,” Dwight interrupted. “I was NEVER sure if you’d be able to pee straight away like you were hoping to.”

Kenneth blinked. Dwight may not have been disappointed in him— Or at least he was trying not to SHOW that he was— but Kenneth was still ashamed. “Well… I couldn’t,” he said. “I drank a lot of soda, then as soon as I had to go, I tried. But, I couldn’t do it… So, I thought I’d try again later, and when I started to need it more, I got… Distracted reading until I suddenly REALLY had to go. But, I couldn’t pee at the library, and then the glass sculpture shop was closed so I couldn’t pee there.

I was desperate, so I tried to go in an alleyway, but I could only get a little bit out before some guys came and startled me and made me stop. So, I had to go to the bath-house and BEG the lady there to let me use the bathroom because they were closed, which was SUPER embarrassing! And, I only managed to go by running my hand under warm water and then RUNNING to the urinal before I had a complete accident. And, I DID hurt myself, because I wore my bladder out so much that I had to stop and go on a tree in the forest, and so I failed everything today, I’m not getting better, and—“

Dwight held a hand up. “Wait, wait.”

Kenneth stopped.

“You consider all of that to be ‘failing’ and ‘not getting better’?”

Kenneth nodded. “I was supposed to be able to—“

“Kenneth, no. Think about this; You managed to get yourself to START going in an alleyway BY YOURSELF. And, even if you couldn’t finish there, you THEN got yourself to use a urinal on your own— And THEN you peed again outside without me needing to be there!”

“But, nobody was even IN the bath-house when I used the urinal,” Kenneth said. “Just a woman, and she wouldn’t have come in to th—“

“Darling, do you remember the last time you used a urinal?” Dwight asked. “I had to lock the door to the bathroom and hold onto you for a while before you could do it. Today, you did it by yourself without a locked door. It doesn’t matter that no one was around to walk in on you, it’s still a VERY big deal, and I’m proud of you.”

Kenneth teared up, after spending so much time thinking he was going to let his friend down, being praised by him instead felt extra good.

Dwight hugged him again. “And, see, in the very end you DID make yourself go when it wasn’t an emergency, didn’t you?”

“Y—Yeah, when I went on the tree, I wasn’t bursting.”

“There you go…” Dwight said. “You did very, very well today.” He kissed his cheek. “So, what’s the third book you got?”

“I don’t actually know. She gave it to me when I was… In a hurry, and I didn’t look.” Kenneth set it down on his bed. It was, indeed, a children’s book. One about a dragon. “I’m not sure why she wanted me to have it. I kind of blurted out my… Er, ’problem’ to her, and she gave me this.”

Dwight sucked in a sharp breath. Kenneth had just… Told a random person about his shy-bladder? Just like that? God, he wished he HAD been with Kenneth today so that he could have watched all of this progress himself! He opened the book, this one was easier for him to read than other books were. Since the words were so large on the page, so spread out, they didn’t jumble together or swap position the way words in other books seemed to.

The story was about a shy dragon that got so nervous that he couldn’t breathe fire if other dragons were around to see. Dwight thought it was PROBABLY meant as a metaphor for a fear of public speaking, and NOT as one for pee-shyness… But, then again, the book made it clear that breathing fire was something the dragons all NEEDED to do and that they couldn’t put it off forever… And it also kept mentioning how a ‘pressure’ started to build up and ‘become painful’ if a dragon didn’t ‘relieve’ the flames quickly enough… Those sorts of things didn’t happen to a person that was just really scared to deliver a speech.

“I… I guess she thought you’d relate to this story…” Dwight said finally.

“I guess…” Kenneth agreed, blushing hard. “How does the dragon fix his problem?”

Dwight flipped through more pages. “Looks like he just practiced a lot… So, the same thing you’re doing.”

Written for the Omovember prompt "Assisted Peeing"

***

Kenneth had never had a worse cold in his life. Ordinarily, the guards wouldn’t be granted days off for a simple cold, nor would they be sent to the medical building over something so minor. Just some throat lozenges, and encouragement to power through, and that would be all.

 But, Kenneth had completely lost his voice. He was not of much use when he couldn’t even communicate. He was of even less use when he couldn’t even communicate and could barely stand up. He was utterly useless when he couldn’t even communicate, could barely stand up, and was hacking up phlegm onto anyone who made the mistake of getting too close.

So, he’d been sent to the medical building to rest up. He was glad for that. He pretty much just laid in bed for hours, drifting in and out of sleep. He lay on top of the sheets, his body kept flashing hot and cold and drenching him in so much sweat that he couldn’t bear to be covered up with anything.

Occasionally, a nurse would attend to him. His nurse was not Elizabeth this time, she was busy assisting other people. Instead, he was with a woman named Olivia whom he did not know particularly well. She took fine care of him, though. She gave him lozenges and plenty of water, and checked in on him pretty often.

But, eventually, all the water Kenneth had been given started to ask to come out. Then it YELLED to come out. He needed to pee, and pretty badly at that. His enormous, steel-bladder was not as strong as it usually was, thanks to the weakened state of his entire body. He went from barely feeling the urge to thinking he was about to pee the sheets in a little under an hour, and it was tough to find the energy to tense up his pelvic muscles and keep it all in.

There were urinal bottles in the cabinet on the other side of the room. He’d tried to stand up to get one a few times now, but even raising his head made the world spin so much he felt like he’d pass out.

He was going to have to wait until Olivia came back, an event which he was eagerly anticipating.

It presented a bit of a problem, though. He had COMPLETELY lost his voice. He couldn’t even manage to emit tiny moans or whimpers, much less the words “I have to relieve myself now, please.” He was going to have to notify the nurse of his present dilemma through some other method.

He wriggled around in his bed. The restless, uncontrollable motion was causing him to get even more dizzy. He tried shutting his eyes against his twisting, twirling surroundings, but somehow that made him feel even MORE sick. He did his best to hold still, but the demands from his bladder to fidget about would return within a matter of seconds.

Finally, Olivia had entered. First, she opened the cabinet and checked the supplies. Kenneth hit his palm against the wall beside his bed to get her attention, trying to indicate that he needed something RIGHT now and didn’t have time for her to take inventory like that.

Olivia turned around to face him. “Do you need something.”

Kenneth nodded, trying to do so slowly and gently, but amplifying his headache anyway.

“What is it? Your throat? Need a lozenge? Water?”

He shook his head, the migraine inside it becoming blisteringly painful from that small motion. He winced and pressed a hand against his forehead.

“Oh, you have a headache,” Olivia said, returning to the supply cabinet.

Kenneth wished he was capable of groaning. Yes, he did have a headache. And yes, he would like medicine for it. But, there was something ELSE he needed way more!

Olivia returned and gave him a pain killer, then watched as he swallowed it with a glass of water. “Is that all you needed?”

Kenneth shook his head, trying to figure out how to get his point across… She’d figured out his head was hurting because he’d grabbed at it… He cringed, this was such an embarrassing thing to do on purpose, but he was too sick to care too much about his pride, he just needed to get this piss out of his body so he could go to sleep again.

Kenneth put his hands between his legs, which were already crossing. He wriggled his hips in a slightly exaggerated way.

“You need to urinate?”

Kenneth nodded. Yes! So much!

Olivia returned to the cabinet once more and retrieved one of the bottles, Kenneth was already letting some of the anxious breath out of his lungs. She unscrewed the cap and knelt down beside him. “Can you undo your pants on your own?”

Kenneth blushed furiously and nodded.

“Okay, I’ll hold the bottle for you while you go, then.”

Fuck.

How was he supposed to explain THIS without the use of words!?

When he’d gone to Elizabeth about his problem, she’d promised not to tell anybody about it— Not even the other medics. He’d been grateful to her for that at the time, but now he wished she HAD told them!

He began to shake his head.

“You do need help with your clothes after all?” Olivia guessed.

More head-shaking. He closed his eyes tightly, pointed at her, then at his shut eyes.

“Are your eyes hurting?”

Ugh… Frustrated, Kenneth shook his head once more. ‘Just leave the bottle and wait outside. I can’t go with you here.’ That was ALL he wanted to say! He opened his mouth and attempted, once more, to speak. His throat had other ideas, and only allowed him to let out a series of hacking coughs that shook the walls of his bladder and made them almost collapse in on themselves. This time, when he grabbed hold of his cock, it hadn’t been deliberate at all. It had been a reflex; a desperate attempt to ensure he didn’t leak— Though he wasn’t sure if he’d even be able to do THAT with Olivia still looking at him.

“Slow breaths now…” Olivia said. “You sure you can manage your clothes?”

Kenneth nodded, shut his eyes again and pointed rapidly between himself and Olivia. ‘I don’t want you to look! Please, just understand that!’ he mentally pleaded.

“I don’t… Oh, you don’t want me to see you?”

More nodding. Yes! Finally, they were getting somewhere!

“Don’t worry, I’ll close my eyes. Cough when you are ready.”

Kenneth’s heart sank. Shutting her eyes was a good start, but he needed her to LEAVE altogether! He had another thought, though. He was so dreadfully tired at the moment, his body most definitely wasn’t behaving the way it usually did. Maybe he was exhausted and sick enough that he didn’t have the ENERGY to get anxious about someone being in the room with him as he peed.

It was a long-shot, but he BADLY wanted to get this piss out of himself so he could return to his sleep. He thought back to other times when he’d been sick, if the illness had had any kind of affect on his bladder shyness. Except, every time he’d been sick in recent memory, Dwight had been there to care for him; the one person whom his bladder didn’t MIND emptying in front of.

Kenneth undid the button on his pajama pants and got himself out. He kept a hand clamped around his exposed dick, both to conceal it better and to help his pee stay where it belonged. He made himself cough, prompting that awful lurching sensation in his bladder once more as Olivia turned around.

“Ready?”

Kenneth nodded. He was dying for this whole thing to be over.

It was far from over, though. Olivia positioned the bottle and held it in place for him, just as she’d promised she would. And she was RIGHT there beside him. Kenneth could hear her breathing; this new person whom he didn’t know at all. SHE was going to hear every hiss and splatter his pee made, SHE was going to feel the way the bottle grew heavy and warm the more he filled it up.

‘She is a nurse, she does that all the time,’ Kenneth told himself. ‘She’s listened to lots of people pee, it’s not different for you…’ But he knew his little mental pep-talk was futile, the fact of the matter was that it WAS different for him. It was VERY different for him. He squeezed his eyes shut once again, trying to calm his nerves enough to at least let go of a little trickle, but he was locked up bad. This was one of the times where he swore there must have been some kind of cork plugging up his bladder, one that was made of indestructible steel and that wouldn’t shatter for anything.

As it settled in to him that he was most definitely NOT going to be able to pee under these conditions, Kenneth’s mind started to race. Olivia, no doubt, was thinking something was wrong with him. She’d just watched him squirm and jiggle and hold himself for several minutes, obviously in urgent need of a pee break, and now that she’d provided him with the answer to his problem, he wasn’t using it. Kenneth’s heart pounded as he imagined what must have been going through her mind;

‘Wow, does he not know how to pee?’

‘He must be broken.’

‘He has some serious issues. He has no business being a guard.’

Kenneth told himself that his thoughts were ridiculous, that he probably wasn’t even the first person to have struggled to let go into a bottle Olivia was holding. All he needed was some way to explain to her that he needed total solitude for this activity, and all would be resolved. She’d just accept that Kenneth liked to have a lot of privacy while he peed, she wouldn’t jump straight to figuring out how deep his issue went.

“It’s okay,” Olivia said. “I’ve got it in the right spot for you.”

Kenneth’s voice was one of his most useful tools. He may not have been the strongest, but he could scream and shout and utilize his voice to get what he wanted. It wasn’t until now that he really understood how valuable his voice really was to him, how badly he needed it. ‘I can’t go in front of you!’ It was just seven words! Seven measly, little words! And he couldn’t manage to tear them out through his phlegmy, scratchy throat.

When Bryce teased Kenneth for his problem, he always called him ‘pee-shy’. Kenneth wasn’t sure if ‘shy’ was really a strong enough word for how he felt when attempting to urinate under observation like this. But, maybe he could come up with some sort of gesture to get the idea of ‘shyness’ across. Kenneth could feel that he was blushing— With as pale as his sickness had made him, it must have looked awful bright too— so that could help.

Kenneth covered his face up with one of his hands, as if trying to hide himself. As he did it, he knew it probably wasn’t going to be understood. But he couldn’t think of anything that was better.

“Getting tired?” Olivia asked. “Go ahead and pee now, I promise you won’t get any on the sheets if that’s worrying you.”

Kenneth didn’t CARE about the sheets. If some of his urine ended up spilling onto them, it wouldn’t matter because at least it wouldn’t be locked away in his bladder anymore! He closed his eyes again, screwing them up tightly and gritting his teeth. Now, he was trying to use his facial expressions to show Olivia ‘I’m trying, but I can’t!’ He hoped she’d be able to discern that a little easier.

“Are you… Having trouble going?”

Yes! Kenneth nodded, certain that he was finally successful. Olivia, at last, understood that he NEEDED to be alone right now!

Olivia was frowning, her brows knit together. She looked way more concerned than Kenneth expected her to… He knew his problem was pretty unhealthy for him, he’d suffered through enough painful experiences that he was well aware of that. But, the solution to it was such a simple one right now. If she was so worried about it, he didn’t understand why she wouldn’t just leave right away so he could go. He wriggled his hips, waiting impatiently for her to do exactly that.

“H—Hold on…” Olivia said eventually. After that, she finally left… But she took the urinal bottle WITH her.

Kenneth was equal parts confused and annoyed. If he was capable of making noise, he would have been shouting up an angry tirade right about now. Olivia had finally grasped that he needed solitude to piss and she’d GIVEN him that, but also taken away the only receptacle he could use TO piss?

He tried to steady his breathing, his rage was making him inhale and exhale way too quickly for his aching chest to be okay with— And it certainly wasn’t doing his bladder any favors, either. Olivia would probably realize her mistake pretty quickly. She’d come back in, give him the precious bottle and say “Oh, that was silly of me. Sorry.” And then she’d walk back out and he’d finally get to go.

He just had to wait a few more minutes, he was sure of it.

Olivia returned soon enough, but rather than handing over the bottle and immediately departing, she spoke gently to Kenneth. “I don’t want to alarm you, I’m sure this is making you very nervous.”

Kenneth nodded. ‘That’s why I need you to LEAVE!’ he wanted to snap.

“I know that you haven’t relieved yourself since I began seeing you hours ago, and that I have been keeping you very hydrated. Your bladder must be VERY full by now.”

Was… Was she freaking TEASING him!? YES, his bladder was FULL! Why else would he be squirming around and holding his crotch? His bladder was so full that just the feeling of his pajama top brushing against his lower belly was sending it into fits of spasms! He felt his face heating up, and he wasn’t sure if the redness no doubt forming there was from embarrassment or anger. What kind of a nurse taunted a patient for needing to go pee?

Why the Hell did Elizabeth have to be so busy with other people? He wanted her! Or any of his friends! Any one of them could get it through Olivia’s head that he COULDN’T freaking control this and didn’t need to be mocked for it! But, Dwight and Bryce were both at their posts. Kenneth wouldn’t see them until they were through for the day— He knew that at least Dwight would surely come to check on him then. Unfortunately, that would be HOURS from now and Kenneth both didn’t WANT to hold it that long and wasn’t too sure if he COULD.

Still, he nodded to Olivia, a little twitchily. He tightened his grip on himself, both because he honestly just NEEDED to and because he wanted to emphasize the severity of his need. He was hoping maybe she’d just take pity on him if he made it blatantly obvious how uncomfortable he was.

“I’m afraid you may be suffering from acute urinary retention,” Olivia informed. “I checked the medications I have been giving you today, and that IS a side effect of one of them.”

Kenneth shook his head back and forth. No. He didn’t have urinary retention. He just had a really, REALLY shy bladder and he’d be fully capable of voiding it as soon as Olivia left him the heck alone!

“I know,” Olivia said. “That sounds scary, and I know you’re in a lot of discomfort right now… Just to make sure, I’m going to check a few things, alright?”

More frantic head-shaking. ‘You don’t have to do that,’ Kenneth wished he could say. ‘I already know that isn’t the problem, this is just what happens when I try to go in front of people! I don’t have TIME for you to check on anything.’

Kenneth had failed to spontaneously gain the power of telepathy, so Olivia came closer to his bed and asked him to pull up his pajama shirt. Kenneth did so, the stupid thing had been teasing his bladder too much anyway, tickling against his aching middle like that.

Olivia looked at Kenneth’s exposed abdomen. While the sight of it, a little engorged and swollen with urine, was a common one to Kenneth, it sure wasn’t to Olivia and worry flashed across her face. “This probably isn’t going to feel good,” she warned. “I’m sorry.”

Kenneth’s heart skipped a beat as he instinctively tried to ask what she was going to do… But, he couldn’t even attempt to drag his voice up kicking and screaming through all the gunk and pain coating his throat, because Olivia acted too quickly.

She placed a hand onto Kenneth’s abdomen and sort of palpitated it a few times. Holy mother of— Sweet merciful— FUUUCK! This wasn’t as bad as the time he’d had an absolute scumfuck of a human being squeezing the Hell out of his bladder, but it WAS a lot like having several boulders slammed against his bladder rapid succession. Boulders that had been lit on fire. His urethral opening flared with electric, white hot pulses of pain as pee tried desperately to pour through his pipes and escape. He tried to LET it, he didn’t care if he peed himself, he just wanted the hurting to stop! Besides, being extremely sick and having someone mash the life out of his bladder was a pretty decent excuse for wetting one’s pants as an adult.

His urine failed to push its way to freedom, instead returning itself to the Hellish, throbbing misery of his bladder once more. Liquid flowed from other places, though. Tears rolled down Kenneth’s face, being drawn forth by the sheer physical agony alone. He hadn’t had anything hurt THAT much in quite a while!

“I’m sorry,” Olivia repeated. “I wanted to see if that would cause you to…” she trailed off, but Kenneth knew what she’d been about to say.

She’d been TRYING to make him wet himself!? He supposed that sort of made sense, as she thought his inability to let go was caused by a serious physical ailment rather than an anxiety that was taking place inside his brain. Still, he didn’t much appreciate having someone attempt to force him to have an accident.

Olivia seemed to notice he was crying, “It’s alright. We can get this treated, it will be sorted out soon. We are probably going to need to use a catheter, have you ever had one before?”

Kenneth’s head flew back and forth. No, please… Not this. Not NOW. Catheterization had always been what Kenneth saw as ‘the end of the line’, and it was something he was terrified of; that one day his problem would reach such a fevered pitch that he’d be forced to have his piss extracted from him like that every time he had to go. To have that happen TODAY, when he knew he’d be perfectly capable of peeing normally if he could just be allowed to have this room to HIMSELF for a bit, was like a knife to his chest.

‘I don’t need that!’ Kenneth tried to cry out. ‘That isn’t the problem!’ But, instead of words, Kenneth only managed to let loose another series of coughs. His bladder, having just been put through the heinous torture of Olivia pushing on it a few minutes ago, flew into angry, wild convulsions again as his body vibrated and heaved. Kenneth gnashed his teeth together, squeezed his dick so hard that it HURT, and felt more tears flowing.

“It isn’t as painful as you think,” Olivia promised. “It definitely will feel better than what you’re going through now… We could use another kind of pain killer if that helps you, are you allergic to any of those?” She touched her forehead lightly. “Oh, I guess you can’t tell me that, huh?”

Kenneth barely heard what she was saying. He couldn’t believe he was going to… That the day had come, that he was going to be catheterized. And, it wasn’t even because his problem had managed to get worse! Nope! Instead it was just because he’d lost the ability to say one stupid, simple, tiny, little sentence!

He made a silent wish for Dwight to be granted leave early today, for Dwight to come right through the door and explain to Olivia what the ACTUAL problem was before Kenneth was subjected to an unnecessary procedure. But, that didn’t happen.

What DID happen was nearly as good, though. “Who usually sees you when you’re sick? Elizabeth, right? Would she be able to tell me more about any allergies?”

Kenneth nodded, hope blooming in his chest. ‘God. YES! Please, go get Elizabeth! I want Elizabeth now!’

Olivia left… And, again, she took the bottle Kenneth wanted so much… He tried not to be too upset about that, he should finally be able to use it very soon!

Olivia came back, Elizabeth beside her. “Now, what’s the matter?” Elizabeth asked. “Paulson is having a reaction to a medication?”

Olivia explained the afternoon’s events. “He’s lost his voice, but I was able to tell that he needs the toilet. So I gave him the bottle as usual. But, when I held it for him he wasn’t able to empty his bladder. I looked into the medicine we’ve been giving him, and a rare side-effect of one of them is urinary retention, so—“

Elizabeth held up a hand, “Olivia, Paulson probably doesn’t have urinary retention. He has… Um…” Elizabeth glanced at Kenneth.

Kenneth nodded, ‘Just tell her, I don’t care anymore!’ he thought.

“He… Gets very nervous about peeing around other people,” Elizabeth explained. “That’s all. It’s difficult for him to relax enough to empty his bladder. It’s much more likely that he just couldn’t go with you so close to him. If you just give him the bottle and leave him here for a bit, I’m sure you won’t have anything to worry about.”

Kenneth already felt relieved as a weight lifted off his shoulders. Finally, all the words he’d been dying to say…

“Oh,” Olivia said. “Um… Paulson, is that what you’ve been trying to tell me?”

Kenneth bobbed his head up and down. He was shaking now, wishing that Olivia would hurry up and get out now that the issue had been laid out for her so clearly.

“And… I pushed down on your… I’m so sorry,” Olivia said. “I had no idea it was something like that, I—“ She stopped herself. Kenneth’s bladder had felt enormous when she’d squeezed it. And he was STILL holding all of that in… She set the bottle down on his bed. “You just need Elizabeth and I out, right?”

Nod. ‘Hurrryyyyyy!’ Kenneth’s brain and bladder screamed in unison.

When Olivia and Elizabeth finally departed from the room, Kenneth tore apart the button on his pajama pants. He sat up as much as his sick body would allow him to and aimed himself into the bottle’s opening. ‘You’re alone now, Paulson…’ Kenneth told himself. ‘Deep breaths…’ After a few steadying inhales and exhales, pee started to noisily rattle against the material of the bottle, and relief washed over Kenneth’s entire body. ‘Dear God, that’s better…’ was Kenneth’s last thought before his brain turned into garbled, staticky mush. For the first time since his illness had started, Kenneth felt something pleasurable.

Quickly, the sound of liquid hitting glass was replaced by the sound of liquid hitting liquid as his release grew in both speed and strength. Shivers darted up and down his spine, and he felt the bottle growing heavier and heavier with each passing second.

Once he was done, he’d nearly filled the thing to its top, just as he had done several times before. He replaced its cap, and then laid himself back down, eager to get back to sleep now that his discomfort had been alleviated.

Olivia came in before he’d drifted off though. She picked up the bottle he’d discarded near the foot of the bed and Kenneth saw deep concern take over her features yet again as she stared at it. Embarrassment bubbled in his chest when he realized that she was probably freaked out by how full the bottle was. To her credit, she didn’t comment on that, instead said “I want to apologize again. I’m very sorry for not understanding what was bothering you. I know now. Next time you have to go, I’ll give you all the privacy you need right away, I promise.”

Written for the Omovember prompt "Holding/Peeing Contest"

***

Elizabeth really thought she needed to thank Bryce again for giving her a way to pee standing up. It was an unusual thing to think, but it really had changed her life. She didn’t need to hold it as long as she used to anymore, because she could do it so much faster and in so many different places.

She didn’t have to hope and pray for a break to come so that she’d have time to go to the restroom, pull her clothing down all the way, sit, pee get re-dressed and wash her hands— A process that could take five minutes, or more if she’d been bursting like she so often was. Five minutes was too long for her to be away from her work.

Instead, she could find a gap in the day, go to the restroom, position the medicine spoon while barely having to mess with her clothes, pee and wash her hands. Even if she was desperate, this could all be accomplished in under three minutes. Three minutes was perfectly acceptable.

It didn’t matter if a toilet was too gross, because she wouldn’t have to touch it anymore. When she was outdoors, she no longer had to squirm and fidget, envying the ease with which men could relieve themselves behind trees. She didn’t have to hold it until she genuinely had no choice, then struggle to get into a position that wouldn’t cause her to pee on her feet, worrying all the while about someone seeing her half-naked. She could go easily and discreetly now!

She wanted to tell Bryce how grateful she was for such a nice thing, but she had no idea how to approach him about it. She decided to just be extra nice to him, so he’d know she appreciated him.

The problem there was how Bryce kept reacting to her. Elizabeth visited him during her break every day, to ask him how he was doing, if he was feeling well, if there was anything he was concerned about. She asked him about his favorite books, his favorite music… But, Bryce didn’t seem to WANT to talk to her.

Bryce would only mumble his responses, looking down at his feet. He’d sweat and begin breathing oddly. Once, when he’d started doing that, Elizabeth had grabbed his wrist to check his pulse and he just turned pale and stammered that he had to go handle something right away.

Elizabeth had thought they’d been becoming friends, but Bryce seemed to be uncomfortable any time she was around. To her surprise, the idea that Bryce didn’t like her made her feel pretty hollow. She hadn’t realized until then how much she’d actually been thinking about Bryce, about spending time with him.

Maybe Bryce had just been going through a hard time lately, though. Maybe he was depressed and didn’t want to talk to anybody.

Except, she saw him talk to Kenneth and Dwight, and some of the other guards, often enough. It was only her that he was trying to avoid.

Now, Elizabeth just wanted an answer, she wanted to know if Bryce had ever SAID anything about her to his friends, anything that may have indicated he found her irritating or… Something.

She ended up having an opportunity to ask one of his friends one day, just not in the way she wanted.

That morning, she’d been on her way to work when she realized she’d forgotten to pee before heading out. STARTING a shift with a full bladder would be a terrible idea— Even with as fast as she could pee now, the early mornings were very busy and she wouldn’t have a chance to go for hours.

The nearest restrooms were quite a ways behind her by that point. She’d have to turn around, walk all the way there, pee, and come back. It would take too long, she’d end up being late. There were plenty of bushes around, however. And she had the medicine spoon device. She’d never urinated outdoors when a toilet was just ten minutes away, but this was a special circumstance. She’d scrub her hands a lot once she got to work. It would be fine.

So long as no one saw…

The medics were typically the only people really milling around this early in the morning. The daytime guards were still asleep, the nighttime ones were still at their posts. Elizabeth was alone. Still, she glanced back and forth before she stepped into the foliage, confirming to herself that no one was around to see her.

***

Dwight had been pretty worried about Kenneth the last few days. The medics had assured him over and over that Kenneth’s cold was absolutely NOT going to be fatal, but Dwight worried anyway. He’d been struggling to sleep through the night. Part of it was the stress, but most of it was the discomfort he now felt if he tried to fall asleep WITHOUT Kenneth in the bed with him. He’d toss and turn, reaching his arms out and trying to grab something warm and comforting, but Kenneth wasn’t there. He’d attempted to use his pillow as a substitute for Kenneth, but this hadn’t worked. If anything, it had just reminded him even MORE of the fact that Kenneth was somewhere else.

Dwight had barely slept at all last night. His bed had been so cold and empty, and without the sound of Kenneth snoring or muttering, the room had been too quiet. Because of this, he’d gotten up earlier than usual. He visited Kenneth three times every day, in the morning, during his break, and at night until the medics kicked him out. If he left now, he’d have extra time to spend with his sick friend this morning.

He got dressed as fast as he could and started to run in the direction of the medical building. It didn’t take long for the harsh thwacks of his boots against the ground to travel through his body and remind him that he’d rushed out without peeing. His bladder was still containing everything from last night.

That wasn’t a problem for Dwight at all, though. He just had to find a bush, and there were plenty of those around. ‘Kenneth says to stop pissing right out where everyone can see…’ Dwight thought, deciding NOT to relieve himself onto the very first bush he saw. Instead, he pushed further into the foliage, trying to make himself a little more concealed. The more he walked through the bushes, the more eager his bladder got. He had to tense his thighs a little while he pressed his way past a few branches, and—

What.

What the Hell?

Dwight’s need for a piss faded from his mind, the pressure within him no longer registering as he just stared, wide-eyed, at one of the oddest things he’d ever seen in his life.

He wasn’t alone back here. Elizabeth was here too. And she was peeing like a man. Her legs were spread apart, her shoulders were back, and a stream of liquid was spraying forwards into the bush in a clear, straight arc. Dwight was so utterly confused by the sight that he spoke before he could think better of it. “I thought girls couldn’t DO that!”

Elizabeth jolted hard, and something dropped out of her hand to land in the grass between her feet. Dwight couldn’t tell what it was, but he watched as Elizabeth quickly retrieved it and stuffed it inside her pocket. “Wh—What are you doing back h—here?” she stammered.

It took Dwight a second to recall why he’d come here. A little flaring pulse at his urethra reminded him, and he started to bob at the knees a little. “I need to pee!” he said. “Sorry that I— Oh, wait! I know!” He turned around, pulled down his zipper, freed himself and allowed his urine to gush into the grass. “Mmm,” he murmured, feeling the tension slide off of his back. “There! Now we’re even!”

Elizabeth stared at him, her mouth forming a harsh line. At least, if someone HAD to catch her doing that, it was someone who obviously couldn’t care less about it.

Dwight finished and yanked his zipper back up, turning to face her again. “How come you can pee standing up?” he asked immediately. “I’ve never seen women do that before… I mean, I haven’t seen women PEE at all before, except when I was little and forgot to knock on the door sometimes, but they were always sitting down. Which I thought made sense because they didn’t have anything to point and shoot with. But, YOU were—“

“Dwight…” Elizabeth said. “Can you at least speak a little softer about this?”

“I’m sorry,” Dwight said. “I’m just really curious, that’s all! You don’t have to explain it if you don’t want to, if you’d rather keep it a secret that’s fi—“ he stopped. “Oh, wait, hold on…”

“What…?” Elizabeth asked, dreading the answer.

“Ummm…” Dwight said. “Can you pee really far?”

“Huh?”

“I mean, a long distance?” Dwight asked. “Can you pee as far as a guy can?”

Elizabeth looked away. “It’s not like I’ve watched men pee before…” That wasn’t completely true. She’d watched Bryce pee the day she’d needed to help him with his zipper. But, he’d been sitting down that time, so she didn’t find out how far he could go. “Why does it matter?”

“Well…When I was a kid, the boys at the orphanage, they sometimes had contests to see who could pee the farthest.”

Elizabeth wrinkled up her nose. “Why…?”

“I don’t know why,” Dwight said. “But, none of them ever let me play because they said I was too small and— I— I mean— They were talking about my height! They said I was too short! That’s what was small— I—“

“Dwight…” Elizabeth sighed. “I really do need to get to work soon, you know?”

“Well, a—anyway,” Dwight said. “I always wanted to play because I felt left out. And then I met Kenneth, so I had a friend to play with… Except trying to pee for a contest made him nervous, so he couldn’t go. Then, when I came here and met Bryce, I asked if HE could do it with me, but he just said that if I ever asked him for that again he’d bludgeon me to death with a cuckoo clock. So, I figured I didn’t have any friends that would ever do this with me— But, YOU’RE my friend, so I was wrong! I just never thought to ask you!”

“Dwight, I— You want to do a contest to see who can—“

“Who can pee the farthest,” Dwight nodded. “We’ll go out into the field I guess, and try to shoot our streams as far away from ourselves as possible.”

“But…Why…?” Elizabeth asked again.

“It always looked really fun when the other kids did it,” Dwight shrugged.

“What was the point, though?” Elizabeth tried again. “Did the winner get anything?”

“Bragging rights, I guess.”

“Bragging rights,” Elizabeth repeated.

“Yes.”

“For… Being able to urinate a long distance.”

“Yes.”

“I take it there were never any girls involved in these ‘contests’?”

Dwight shook his head. “Well, no. But, the orphanage was all boys anyway, and up until now I didn’t think girls could even play this game.”

Elizabeth was not at all surprised to learn Dwight had grown up surrounded only by boys. It explained why he’d be so excited at the prospect of a literal pissing contest. “What about the nuns?” she asked. “They were all women…”

“They didn’t compete.”

Elizabeth shut her eyes tightly. The sun had barely risen, she hadn’t gotten to work yet, and her head was already hurting. She was starting to understand why Bryce had a short temper with Dwight sometimes. “That’s not what I meant…”

“Oh, well the contests were always in the forest behind the orphanage. They didn’t see. Maybe if they did, they would have made the boys let me join.”

“I… I don’t think so…” Elizabeth mumbled softly. “I honestly can’t say that I understand the appeal here.”

“It’s just supposed to be fun.”

“Peeing isn’t a game,” Elizabeth said. “It’s just something you have to do.”

“It can be both,” Dwight said, his face falling. “You don’t want to do it? Awww, but— But, I don’t have anybody else left to ask. And it’s so neat that you can play at all to begin with! I bet lots of girls wish they could!”

Elizabeth would bet NOT. But, the way Dwight kept emphasizing how amazed he was that she was even capable wasn’t such a terrible thing to hear. And, an odd part of her was even a little flattered that he would consider her for ‘competition’.

All her life, Elizabeth had been told that since she was a girl, her future was set in stone. She was going to be a wife and mother. She was going to stay in the home, cook, clean and take care of children. Her husband would do everything else. He would work. He would make money. Elizabeth would just stay at home to prepare his food. Elizabeth wouldn’t have a job, because she could never compete with men.

When she started training to become a medic, her parents had been disappointed in her. These, they said, were her prime years— The time of her life where she should have been looking for a husband, not busying herself with work that would never fulfill her as much as motherhood would. When Elizabeth said she wasn’t even sure if she wanted kids— And that she at least knew she didn’t want them just YET, they were appalled. They demanded to know what she planned to do without a family and husband to support her, because she could never compete with men.

When she started working, she was happy to see so many other female medics, it was a sign that maybe she wasn’t ‘weird’ or ‘defective’ for not being in a rush to find a husband and have children. Other women were working, too. But, then she learned that all of the male medics were getting paid more than she and the other women were. Even the ones that weren’t as attentive to the patients, or were unorganized, or couldn’t give shots correctly. And some of the men she worked with made no effort to conceal the fact they felt she shouldn’t even BE there to start with, because she could never compete with men.

And here Dwight was now, in an extremely weird way, treating her as an equal. “Okay,” she said. “I’ll do this with you, but can you do something for me, too?”

Dwight smiled brightly. “Sure!” he said. “What do you need?”

“Could you tell Bryce I want to talk to him?” Elizabeth requested.

Dwight went quiet for a second. He was expecting Kenneth to say “Why would you want THAT?” but then remembered Kenneth wasn’t beside him right now. Kenneth wasn’t where he BELONGED right now. He frowned slightly. He had to hurry to the medical building if he wanted to spend any real time with his friend… “I guess I could tell Bryce that,” Dwight said.

“Thanks,” Elizabeth said. “We can… We can do this contest thing this evening.”

“Great!” Dwight grinned broadly. “Make sure you drink plenty!”

***

“D—Dwight…” Kenneth muttered groggily through a cough. “Don’t do that…”

Dwight set down the water and gave his friend a smile. “Yay! You got your voice back!”

“I did…” Kenneth agreed. His tone was hoarse and very quiet, but he was finally able to speak. “Don’t drink my water, you’ll—“

“I’ll get you more,” Dwight said. “Don’t worry.”

“You’re gonna catch my cold…” Kenneth pointed out.

“Oh, right. Sorry. I just have to drink a lot today,” Dwight explained.

“Why? It isn’t that warm.”

“Elizabeth’s gonna do the distance contest with me!”

Kenneth tiredly blinked up at his friend for several seconds, trying to figure out what he was referring to. After a moment, he recalled the peeing contests Kenneth had tried and failed to indulge his friend in during their childhood. But, that couldn’t be it, surely? “What do you mean?”

“You remember,” Dwight said. “When we tried to see which of us could pee the farthest, but you kept getting too shy so we’d have to stop.”

So, that WAS it?! Kenneth was confused. Perhaps the cold had clogged up his ears and he’d misheard him. “But… Elizabeth’s gonna do it?”

“Yeah,” Dwight nodded. “Isn’t that neat? I never even thought to ask her before!”

“Er… But, I thought…” Kenneth trailed off. The one thing he’d always believed would make his shy bladder even HARDER to manage would be if he’d been a woman instead of a man. If he was required to take off some of his clothes all the way to urinate, expose so much of his body. If he had no CHOICE but to sit down on the toilet, in that much more vulnerable position. If he then wouldn’t even be able to aim his stream so that it landed AWAY from the water rather than noisily spraying directly into it. If he had no way to relieve himself into a container if he’d managed to find a secluded spot. If he would need to get half-naked and crouch every time he was forced to try to go outdoors. Kenneth figured that, had he been a woman, he probably would have literally exploded by now. “I thought women had to sit…?”

“I thought so too,” Dwight said. “But, I guess not all of them do. I had to go before I came to visit you this morning, and so I went behind the bushes—“

Kenneth sighed, “I am sure you were really close to a toilet. There are a few of those between our barrack and here.”

“I had to go right THEN, though,” Dwight said. “Anyway, Elizabeth was already back there and she was peeing like a man. So, that means some women CAN do that, and Elizabeth can play the game with me. And I need to drink lots of water today so it’s a good competition.”

“… Well, I’m happy you finally found someone to play with, I guess,” Kenneth said.

***

Dwight tapped his foot as he stood at his post. He’d made goon on his word, he’d drank tons of water, and now his length was starting to ache. His bladder was throbbing, begging for permission to relax. He weaved from side to side, his legs crossing and uncrossing nonstop.

“Smith,” Bryce said from beside him. “Go ahead and relieve yourself now.”

Dwight made himself straighten up. Right away, his bladder pulsated and his muscles twinged. He rubbed his ankles together and adjusted his fly anxiously.

“Relieve yourself,” Bryce sighed. “That’s an order.”

“Wh—What time is it?” Dwight asked.

Bryce checked his watch and read off the time to Dwight, whom frowned. Ten more hours until Elizabeth had said she’d be available for the contest. No way would Dwight contain himself that long. His holding muscles were trembling beneath the weight of his need already! He could go now, then have more to drink to recoup the loss. He’d have plenty of time to fill up again. “Okay,” he said, unzipping and immediately gushing a torrent into the dirt. “Phew…” he sighed, rubbing a hand beneath his navel, enjoying the sensation of his bladder shrinking away inside him.

Bryce rolled his eyes. “That feel better?”

“Yeah…” Dwight murmured, barely audible over the rushing hiss of his stream.

“You know, you can TELL me when you have to go, right?” Bryce asked. “You’re allowed to go here. All I ask is that you give me a little bit of warning first and don’t SPLASH me— Again.”

Dwight blushed, buttoning his clothes back up. “Sorry about that time,” he said. “I had to go real bad that day, and I didn’t realize it was gonna come out so fast!”

“Right, well you still could have at least let me know that you were about to start pissing so I could get out of the way…” Bryce said. He watched as Dwight opened his canteen and took several long, loud gulps. “You’re gonna have to go THAT badly again if you keep that up.”

 “That’s the point,” Dwight said.

“You just like being desperate to piss?” Bryce asked. That was unusual. While Bryce could admit he enjoyed a bit of pain now and then in the right context, the internal wars his body waged every time his bladder was fighting not to overflow itself weren’t pleasurable.

“No,” Dwight shook his head.

“Then, why—“

“I’m doing a contest tonight,” Dwight said excitedly. He explained the purpose of the competition.

Bryce shook his head. “You finally found someone who will do that stupid thing with you?”

“Yep.”

Bryce shrugged. Maybe Kenneth had both finally recovered from his illness and begun feeling bold enough to try this out again. “Well, I hate to say it, but I’m going to have to bet on Paulson being the winner here. The man pees like he’s trying to put out a forest fire. He can probably spray it for miles if he tries.”

“It’s not Kenneth,” Dwight said. “He’s still too sick. And too shy.”

“Who, then?”

“Elizabeth,” Dwight replied.

And he’d expected Bryce to look surprised, maybe ask a question like Kenneth had, but instead the other man’s face just went completely pale, his mouth forming a harsh line as he stared straight ahead, falling silent.

“Bryce…?” Dwight asked. “What’s—“

Bryce grabbed Dwight by the shirt collar and tugged him closer. “What did you just say!?” he demanded.

Dwight squirmed, stumbling backwards. “I— I said Elizabeth was going to do this with me,” he said. “I know, it’s a shock that she CAN, but I’m just happy someone finally agreed.”

Bryce’s mind was racing. Had Dwight seen Elizabeth peeing with the device? Where would he have seen that? Why was he looking at her while she did something so private? How did he get her to agree to THIS? Had he threatened to tell others that she peed like a man if she didn’t do what he—

No.

His runaway brain managed to find the proper pathway again. Bryce knew Dwight. Dwight was… Annoying, a klutz, a bit of an airhead… But, he was a NICE annoying, klutzy airhead. Dwight wasn’t the sort of person that would spy on someone and then blackmail them into doing anything they didn’t want to do. A little pit formed in Bryce’s chest and he felt like something inside him was being sucked down into it. He was a bit ashamed that he’d thought, even if it was only for a second, that Dwight would do that. He took in a deep breath, “Elizabeth… Elizabeth agreed to this?”

Dwight nodded. “Yes. I went to pee behind the bushes this morning and accidentally saw her there. And I told her about the game and asked if she’d play with me, and she said yes.”

Bryce felt better with every word that came from Dwight’s mouth. Of course he’d walked in on her by complete accident. Of course he’d just gotten overly enthusiastic and blurted out things about his silly peeing game. THAT was the sort of person Dwight was. He was a bumbling, awkward guy that wanted to do something he thought was fun, not a peeping pervert looking for a way to manipulate anybody. The guilty pit inside Bryce grew larger. He shouldn’t have snapped at Dwight like that, shouldn’t have grabbed him…

“Oh!” Dwight added. “I just remembered; She said she wanted me to do something for her, too. She wanted me to tell you she wants to talk to you.”

Bryce blushed, looked away. “Sh—She does?” he asked. “But… She’s hard to talk to.”

“No, she isn’t,” Dwight shrugged. “I talked to her a lot this morning.”

“That’s because most people have something to tell them to shut up, but you’re missing it.”

“Well yeah,” Dwight said. “Kenneth’s still sick in bed.”

“I meant a brain,” Bryce corrected.

“Oh.”

“Yeah…”

“Well, Elizabeth DOES want to talk to you,” Dwight told him, taking another sip from his canteen. The major challenge now was trying to fill himself up at a rate that would ensure he had a lot of pee stored inside him by the time the contest began, but not SO fast that it forced him to relieve himself too early. He subconsciously starting to squeeze his thighs together, fists twitching at his sides. He didn’t have to go very much now, but he knew it would all be hitting him soon enough. His bladder could still remember the discomfort from earlier, and his entire lower half was still sore.

***

Time slowed down for a person whenever they needed to pee. Elizabeth’s glances were turning into hateful stares every time she looked at the clock. Time was having a lot of fun dragging itself along.

‘I have to go so bad…’ Elizabeth kept thinking. Over the course of the morning, her desire to urinate had grown from a slight urge to a majorly painful spasm that flared through her abdomen. She actually HAD time to relieve herself right now, she HAD a few minutes to herself in which she could go to the toilet and release all the urine she was holding onto.

She was frustrated with herself for letting the opportunity pass her by, and even more frustrated because she knew exactly why she was making such a terrible choice. She actually wanted to WIN Dwight’s silly, little game. She hadn’t been too concerned about being victorious at first. But, that had been before a piercing comment from one of the male medics; “If you really want to make yourself useful, how about you have breakfast ready for us every morning, little lady? Use your actual skills for once.”

Elizabeth couldn’t cook at all, and even if she could, it wouldn’t be for him. She knew she should let such things slide off of her, they were only words. So long as SHE knew her worth, it shouldn’t have mattered if nobody else did, right?

But, it DID matter. It mattered that she could do things just as well, if not better, than the male medics only to have them talk to her like she was an incompetent child every day anyway. It mattered that no matter what she accomplished, people would still look at her as being less capable. That was why it mattered that she could beat a man at something that everybody said ONLY men could do at all; It mattered that she could piss further than Dwight.

So, she held it.

***

Dwight was tugging nervously at his belt. A wave of pain was crashing through his body, and he could feel his holding muscles vibrating with the effort of retaining all his pee. He released his belt, clenched his hands into fists and tightened up his lower body, stomping his feet hard against the ground. For now, that was holding back his urge, but how long would it last? “Nnnh… Gotta goooo…” he mumbled. “I need to peeeeee….” Some of the tension faded as he gave his bladder a voice, so he kept going. “I need to pee soooooo bad….”

“You can,” Bryce pointed out, a sway in his hips as he watched Dwight squirm and writhe. For the billionth time, he wished his bladder weren’t so suggestible. So many things made him need to go. The sound of rain, the flush of a toilet, the sight of someone else struggling to hold it… Anything that made Bryce THINK about pissing would make him feel like he had to START pissing. It was so annoying. “Just go.”

Instead of whipping it out and emptying himself, Dwight asked “What time is it?”

Bryce groaned and checked his watch again. He told Dwight the time, and the other man frowned.

“Nnnh, that’s a long time left to wait…” Dwight murmured. He uncrossed his legs, switched them around and started to jiggle. One major problem was that he was IN a spot where he relieved himself frequently. His bladder recognized he was somewhere that it was okay to pee, so it believed it was going to be emptied soon and kept flaring and trying to pump its contents out.

“I’m sure you’ll have to go again by the time you have your stupid contest,” Bryce said. “If you’re not gonna pee can you at least stop tapping your feet? You’re kicking up dirt.”

Dwight hadn’t even realized he’d been tapping his feet. The only thing he’d been thinking about was piss, after all. Piss, and how bad he had to get it out of his bladder. Maybe he could let out just a little? Enough that he could hold it, but not SO much that he risked being too empty for the contest?

Dwight unzipped and aimed, relief flowing over him and out of him right away as a thick, clear stream jetted to the ground between his feet. His eyelids drooped and his shoulders shuddered. Much better, much better… After a few seconds, he thought it was probably time to stop, so he tried to clench his muscles and cut off his stream.

A horrid, pinching poke flared through his urethra, like having a sewing needle stuffed into it. His pee slowed to a dribble, stopped, and then he was spraying with more force than ever. He panted, blinking the pained tears from his eyes. He couldn’t stop, he absolutely couldn’t! Stopping hurt so bad, and peeing felt so good! He just had to finish what he’d started!

Bryce looked away from Dwight, covering his ears against the loud hiss of his stream. Bryce squirmed a lot more now that he was being forced to listen to Dwight GO rather than just endure him complaining that he NEEDED to. Displeasure rippled through his own bladder and he tightened his thighs, stamping his feet against the ground. “Hnnng…” he winced. “Almost done yet?”

“I really, REALLY needed to pee,” Dwight informed, as if that hadn’t been obvious before.

Bryce chewed on his lip, he crossed his legs, he told himself to hold it and NOT relieve himself in front of Dwight again today. A little droplet of urine formed at the tip of his penis, soaking into his boxers and— “Ah— Screw it!” he hurriedly unzipped himself and let the full swell of his bladder go all over the ground. His stream hissed and gushed and he didn’t try to fight it.

This was all Dwight’s fault, anyway. If Dwight hadn’t spent so long talking about pee, if he hadn’t pissed right there where Bryce could see and hear him, then Bryce would have been able to hold it the rest of the day just fine! It was Dwight’s fault that he’d gotten too full just now! Any other day, Bryce would have made it!

***

Elizabeth was sat outside the medical building. Her legs were squeezing together so tightly she thought she could have crushed metal between them. It was her break time now— Another fine opportunity for relief which she was going to refuse to take. She wondered if she peed NOW, she’d be able to make it through the rest of the day alright and still fill back up again by the time she met up with Dwight. Or, maybe if she just let SOME of the pee go now, she’d be able to manage herself a little better.

She stayed by the medical building during her break. She always did. There could be an emergency, after all. All the water stretching her bladder swished around inside her, reminding her that there very much WAS an emergency going on right now. A powerful spasm swept through her and she was just about to cup herself when Olivia sat down beside her. “Elizabeth? Are you alright?” she asked.

Elizabeth’s hand, halfway to its destination, snapped immediately behind her back and she blushed hard. “I’m fine,” she said.

“You look like…” Olivia lowered her voice. “You look like you may need to relieve yourself.”

Elizabeth faced away from Olivia. “I’m fine,” she repeated.

“You know it isn’t healthy to wait,” Olivia chided. “You have time to go now, so—“

“It’s— It’s for a bet,” Elizabeth stated. “Alright?”

Olivia looked confused. “Um… A bet?”

“Yes.”

“Elizabeth, you usually take such good care of yourself,” Olivia said. “I don’t understand why you’d risk your health for a bet. That isn’t like you.”

Elizabeth KNEW it wasn’t like her to do something this silly. She couldn’t believe how this weird game of Dwight’s had warped itself into some sort of test Elizabeth could take in order to prove her worth. It wasn’t like any of the men here would respect her any more if she happened to piss further than Dwight did. Dwight ALREADY respected her, and the men who DIDN’T wouldn’t even see it happen. What difference would it make, really?

But, Elizabeth would know. SHE would know that she’d beaten a man at a thing which no woman was SUPPOSED to be able to beat him at. SHE would know that she really was just as good, just as capable, just as important. SHE would know that she could do absolutely anything a man could do.

And maybe, that would be enough.

“I have to do this,” she told Olivia.

Olivia rolled her eyes. “Well… I hope you don’t wet yourself…”

‘Me too…’ Elizabeth thought. She pressed a clenched fist against her crotch and rocked back and forth into it. She was really bursting, and she needed to hope that the next few hours would pass quickly.

***

Kenneth tiredly glanced up as his friend stumbled into his room. Dwight’s legs were shaking, and his knees kept knocking into each other and making it very hard for him to walk. Kenneth half expected him to trip and fall flat on his face. “H—Hello…” he said groggily.

“Hi, Kenneth,” Dwight said, bouncing on the spot and squirming madly. “I really, really need to pee right now. My bladder feels like it’s stretching out and about to make me explode into a billion pieces. So, don’t talk about water, okay? Or lakes. Or rivers. Or waterfalls, or— Gah, don’t talk about it! Don’t you listen? I need to pee!”

Kenneth stared at him.”…Okay,” he said after a moment. “I’ll talk about dry stuff, I promise.” He sighed, thinking that very soon Dwight’s pants wouldn’t qualify as ‘dry stuff’. “How have you been?”

“Great!” Dwight said. One hand gently clasped at his front. “I have to pee really, really bad though. But that’s okay.”

“Right…” Kenneth said. He was hoping Dwight didn’t notice that his legs were crossed beneath his bedsheets. He’d been holding his own bladder for a while now, the urine bottles all in the drawer and his head still too fuzzy for him to stand up and grab one. He’d been patiently waiting for Dwight to come visit him so he could request his assistance, but from the looks of it, if Kenneth peed the sound would make Dwight burst. Hell, even if Dwight left the room first, the simple knowledge that Kenneth was going would likely cause an accident.

Kenneth could wait until Olivia got back, he supposed. He tightened his thighs, and froze when he realized one of his hands was lifting towards his mouth. He quickly tucked his hands beneath his body so that he wouldn’t chew on them. “But, other than that you’re alright?”

“Yeah,” Dwight said, bouncing from foot to foot. He wanted to talk to his friend, but it was hard to focus on anything besides the aching pain lying within his bladder. “Oooh… I gotta peeee…”

“Couple more hours, right?” Kenneth asked. He was forever doing mental calculations when he compared himself to his friend. If Kenneth was told he’d have to restrain a full bladder for a couple more hours, he’d be miserable from the need but certain he could manage it. Dwight couldn’t hold it anywhere near as long as Kenneth could, though. Two hours may be too much for him. “Think you can handle that?”

Dwight nodded slowly, uncertainly. He didn’t know if he could! At the current rate of escalation, he didn’t think it would be long until he was standing in a puddle of his urine. He would maybe be able to withstand ONE more hour, but TWO? “I— I can hold it…” he said.

Kenneth’s legs uncrossed subconsciously, moving to a different position. But, his knees kept rubbing together. “If you’re sure…” he said.

Dwight wasn’t sure. He kept trying to converse with Kenneth, kept trying to talk about things that WEREN’T his bladder, but his brain kept turning to mental images of himself standing in the field, releasing all of his pee, tension gradually flowing out… His breathing went shallow as he imagined the feeling of the relief overtaking him. It was almost enough to make him want to go right where he was…

Hss!

Warm liquid started to trickle against the front of his boxers and Dwight tightened his lower body. Something had come out! He winced, a hand shooting against his crotch. His hand didn’t make contact with any dampness, but the head of his cock felt wet— The cold sogginess teased the sensitive skin and taunted him with the prospect of better, real relief if he just gave up and let it all out.

“So, then Bryce actually chased after me, even though he was STILL covered in the tomato sauce,” Kenneth was saying, trying to recount a story to distract Dwight— and himself— from the need to pee.

“Uh-huh…” Dwight nodded, barely paying attention. His eyes kept flicking to the cabinet. There were urine bottles in there, he knew. What he wouldn’t give to use one…

Before long, his break was over and he had to return to his post. He was halfway to the door when he made himself stop, feet stomping against the floor urgently. His body was begging him to hurry to his post. As if he could force time to move quicker if HE moved quicker. “Kenneth, do you need anything before I go?”

Kenneth looked away, his need to pee had grown a lot over the last hour. Dwight’s dancing and frequent mumblings of “I gotta goooo!” hadn’t helped at all. He didn’t want to taunt his friend, but then again, Dwight was basically CHOOSING to do this to himself. “Er… Um… Could I have… One of… The… Um…”

Dwight kept shifting. He knew this was going to take a while if he waited for Kenneth to spit the words out himself, so he said “Do you need to pee, Kenneth?”

“… Yes,” Kenneth agreed softly.

Dwight opened the drawer and retrieved a bottle. Without noticing, his other hand immediately palmed his zipper, fingers grasping it as if to pull it down. Relief was in his grasp now, his bladder was thrashing madly at the notion that he was about to give it up. A twinging spasm cut through him and made a rippling shudder go up his spine, it coldly fell back down his body, plummeting into the depths of his bladder and he now had to wrap his around his dick to keep his flood where it belonged.

Dwight took a few stiff steps over to Kenneth’s bed, tossed the bottle to him with a “H—Here!” and rushed from the room.

***

Elizabeth struggled out into the field, finally starting to feel a bit of trepidation. There wasn’t any cover here, it was so open. Someone could walk right by and see her doing this really peculiar, unseemly thing. But, would that really be SUCH a bad thing? Maybe any accidental witness would simply just be as amazed by the sight as Dwight had been.

Besides, her bladder felt like a fifty pound lead weight in her gut right now. Her urethra was spasming wildly, and she kept pushing a fist against her groin but it wasn’t doing much to lessen the pressure. She couldn’t wait much longer.

But, wait longer she did. Dwight was taking a while to show up. She bounced on her heels and coiled her legs together, holding her breath as frenzied spasms traveled through her lower half. She hoped Bryce hadn’t made Dwight stay longer than usual today for some reason. She needed him here soon!

“I KNOW!” Elizabeth heard Bryce shout. “Shut up about it! We’re almost there!”

“I’m gonna burst!” Dwight was whining. “I’ve been holding on forever!”

Oh.

Oh no.

The cool composure Elizabeth had been trying to hang onto all day vanished, she was suddenly very tense, anxious and wary of her surroundings.

Bryce was… WHY was Bryce coming here with Dwight? That hadn’t been part of the deal!

Elizabeth didn’t have time to wonder, because a moment later the two were right in front of her. Dwight was tied up in all manner of knots, while Bryce merely looked irritated to be here.

Why WAS he here?!

“Bryce…?” Elizabeth said, her face fraught with worry. She was managing to quell her pee dance down to simply making subtle, little hops where she stood, the heels of her shoes almost touching. ‘You’ve peed in front of him before,’ Elizabeth thought. ‘You’ve peed STANDING in front of him. You’ve peed STANDING in front of him while he was HOLDING you… It’s okay, it’s okay—‘

It didn’t feel okay.

“Smith needed help walking,” Bryce explained dryly. “He hasn’t gone since before his break today, so I think you should start this as soon as you can.”

Okay. So he was here because Dwight was so desperate to piss he’d needed someone to lean on and assist him with reaching the field. Fine. Okay.

But it didn’t FEEL okay!

“Do you have to stay and w—watch this?” Elizabeth asked.

“Elizabeth!!” Dwight complained. “Now, please? Now!?”

Bryce was turning crimson. “I wasn’t— I wasn’t going to!” he said. “I’d never— I’m not meant to see… This.”

Elizabeth realized her hand was still cupping her groin and felt herself turning very red as well. She tried to move stop clutching, but when she relaxed her hold even a little, she felt warmth flowing down into her underwear and had to tighten back up again. “It’s just… I… I’m not sure if I want you to—“

“It’s okay,” Bryce said. “If it makes you feel too weird, I’ll leave.”

“That’s… I already make you uncomfortable,” Elizabeth explained. “This will make it—“

“Huh!?” Bryce asked. “No. No, no. No. You don’t.”

“But, you always try to avoid me, or run off when I’m talking to you.”

“Elizabeth! It’s GOTTA be now! It’s almost coming out!” Dwight exclaimed.

“Dwight, HOLD it,” Bryce snapped. “That’s an order!”

“But— But I caaaaaan’t!”

“You’d better!” Bryce shouted. He turned back to Elizabeth.“You don’t make me uncomfortable,” he told her. “You just make me feel… Stuff. And I’m not good with feelings, so I… Try not to have them. But, I KEEP having them anyway, and they’re all really confusing and tangled together, and I can’t get rid of them.”

“…Oh,” Elizabeth said. “About… About me?”

“About you. About Paulson. About Smith…” Bryce mumbled, unsure if he wanted to be heard. “About me… Everything’s just… A mess. I keep wanting things that I shouldn’t, and I don’t know what to do to make it stop.”

“I can’t hold it!” Dwight cried. “Please talk later?! Please?!”

“Er, yeah…” Bryce said. “You’d better go… Do that silly thing Dwight wants you to do now. Otherwise I’m pretty sure we’re gonna be holding a funeral for his bladder soon.”

“You’re probably right,” Elizabeth agreed. “And… Um… I guess you can stay here if you want…”

“Okay,” Bryce said.

Elizabeth stood by Dwight’s side. He was grabbing himself with both hands, anxiously rocking back and forth. “F—Finally…” he said. “Now?”

Elizabeth nodded, red faced. She lowered her underwear to her knees and pulled the medicine spoon from her skirt pocket, tucking it into place.

Dwight had been watching. “Ohhh,” he said. “S—So, you pee THROUGH a thing? That’s how it w— Ah—!” he was cut off by a jet of piss sloshing into his boxers. He’d lost many spills like that today, and his crotch felt very clammy and damp. He hurried to unzip and freed his cock, a small clear drop hanging off its tip. He squeezed himself tightly as it plinked to the ground.

“Yes…” Elizabeth said. “That’s— Bryce made it for me, actually.”

“Oh,” Dwight said, he faced forwards, still clutching his aching dick. He really wanted to let go now— His bladder THOUGHT it was time to let go! His zip was down, he was outside, it was supposed to be time to pee! He didn’t want to start too soon, though.

Elizabeth didn’t mean to, but her eyes shifted a bit to the side, and she was able to see Dwight’s penis, the view a bit obscured by the stranglehold he had on his shaft. It wasn’t the first one of those she’d seen, dealing with some of the injuries she’d dealt with, she’d ended up seeing quite a few while dressing wounds. And she’d caught a view of Bryce’s before as well… Her face heated as her brain automatically made a comparison between Dwight’s cock and Bryce’s. They were about the same length, but she thought Bryce’s was probably thicker.

“Please say you’re ready now…” Dwight whimpered. “O—Or, if you’re just getting shy like Kenneth, tell me that?”

“I’m ready,” Elizabeth said, spreading her legs apart a bit. “One… two… thr—“

Before Elizabeth could finish counting, Dwight’s stream was spraying out of him with an intensely heavy force. “Hahhhhhhh….” he moaned, eyes going droopy, vision fogging up with relief. He actually forgot for a moment that he was supposed to be shooting for distance. When he remembered, he bent backwards a bit and pushed hard, his urine firing far out in front of him.

Elizabeth relaxed her lower muscles, and she felt something warm flowing downwards, landing into the medicine spoon and trickling out the opening in the bottle… To land just a few inches in front of her.

Dwight was winning. By a lot.

She looked over and saw the position Dwight had taken, one which allowed his stream to arc out in a greater distance. Elizabeth wasn’t sure how she could DO that, gravity being what it was. If she bent back like that, the piss would flow back TOWARDS her instead of down through the spoon, it would just be a mess.

But, maybe relying on the spoon was the problem?

Without a second thought, she dropped the spoon to the ground, and for a moment her pee was spraying against the inside of her thigh. Her hands went beneath her skirt, and she used them to spread her private area slightly, then pushed with all her strength.

Truth be told, Elizabeth hadn’t entirely expected all of that to work, but it did. She was sending her stream of piss straight forwards— Without the aid of the spoon. She spread her feet more, and leaned backwards as far as she could. At that angle she couldn’t actually SEE how far she was peeing.

 After a minute, her bladder started to feel pretty empty, her stream losing its power. She shut her eyes and pushed one more time. She grimaced as the last drops of her pee ran down her legs, then stood up straight again. She stared out into the field, at the two puddles of urine darkening the dirt. She blinked at them for a moment, stunned.

“Aww,” Dwight said, zipping up. “I lost… But, that was still lots of fun!”

Elizabeth turned to him. She was still surprised, not just by the fact she’d won, but by the fact Dwight didn’t seem BOTHERED by that. Even when he’d admitted defeat, all he’d said was“I lost”. Not “I lost TO A GIRL.” That distinction didn’t seem to exist in his mind. Maybe that was due to him being a ditz, lacking the awareness other people had. Or maybe, it was actually because Dwight was SMARTER than a lot of people in some ways.

He really saw her the same exact way he saw his other friends. Elizabeth had never met a man who did that.

“You liked that?” Elizabeth asked.

“Yeah,” Dwight said. “Except for the part where you and Bryce kept talking and making me hold it.”

“Heh, well, I promise I’ll be faster if we ever play this again.”

“You mean it?” Dwight asked. “We can do it again!?”

“I don’t see why not.”

Written for the Omovember prompt "And There Was Only One Toilet".

***

All three of them had had the day off, which was a rarity. Even more rare, they’d actually CHOSEN to spend it together in town and then share a room at the inn overnight. Most of the day had gone well, but by the time they got TO the inn, both Kenneth and Bryce were bursting for a piss.

Kenneth had been an idiot, he’d thought that since he’d found that one shop with the extra-secure stalls where he could pee so easily, he could drink as much as he wanted today! So, he’d guzzled can after can of his favorite soda, and when he had to go, he’d insisted they all visit that shop.

And it had been closed for the day.

Bryce had also been an idiot, but where Kenneth at least had the excuse that he couldn’t have predicted the shop wouldn’t be open, Bryce really had no excuses whatsoever. He’d just insisted all day that he barely had to go, even as he’d started to squirm, and when it got bad enough that he'd finally admitted to it, it was too late in the evening to find him somewhere to relieve himself.

Dwight was the only one NOT about to explode when they entered the inn. He’d peed a few times throughout the day, only deciding to start holding it after Kenneth discovered he wouldn’t be able to use the toilet at the shop— Which hadn’t been TOO long ago, so Dwight was still pretty empty.

He was NOT looking forward to the argument Kenneth and Bryce were sure to have when they remembered they were ALL sharing one room and, thus, there would be just a single toilet for both of them to use. Dwight hoped he’d be able to diffuse it quickly enough. “Kenneth should go first,” he’d say. “Kenneth’s only desperate because the place where he can pee was closed. YOU’RE desperate because you were being stupid.”

Then again, Kenneth usually had a hard time going if someone was waiting on him, so maybe Dwight should tell Bryce to go first? Would Kenneth feel betrayed?

Dwight’s worries didn’t end up mattering, because he wasn’t going to be present for their argument. He bumped into someone whom had grown up in the same orphanage he’d lived in as a child, and was stuck there as the other man attempted to catch up with him.

And, like Hell were Kenneth OR Bryce going to stand around and hold it while that happened. They both hurried up to their room.

Bryce fumbled the key into the door, bouncing up and down while Kenneth jiggled beside him and muttered; “Hurry, hurry, hurry, please hurry up,” under his breath.

The door finally opened, they both rushed in and it finally hit them that there was only one restroom.

“Y—You go f—first,” Kenneth said, to Bryce’s surprise.   Bryce’s bladder begged him to take Kenneth up on the offer, but no way was he gonna let Kenneth show off how much more HE could hold, how much longer HE could wait. It was like Kenneth was saying “Oh, I’m bursting, but I can tell YOU need it even worse than I do. Hurry up now, don’t want Bryce to have an accident, do we?”

Well, that wasn’t true! Bryce could definitely still hold it, he wasn’t going to have an accident, and he could certainly hold it until after Kenneth was finished. His bladder throbbed at the direction of his thoughts, the surges powerful enough that he had to squeeze his dick a little bit tighter. God… Imagining himself waiting by the door, hearing Kenneth’s waterfall hiss into the bowl, and those ridiculous moans he always let out… “No, Paulson. You should go first.”

Kenneth was confused, Bryce was clearly dying to go. He’d expected the other to jump at the opportunity… Instead he was just still jumping in place and holding it. It was JUST like Bryce to be a stubborn asshole about this, though. Kenneth’s thighs strained together and he used the hand not being gnawed on to grasp onto his crotch. He squeezed his eyes closed. “N—No, you should go first. You REALLY should…”

Bryce was more annoyed now. Kenneth should have been grateful! It wasn’t often Bryce showed kindness like this. Even if it WAS just to prove a point. “N—No, Paulson, I insist… You first.”

Kenneth plucked the hand from his mouth and lowered it to join his other one, pressing down on himself as hard as he could. ‘Please, Bryce. For the love of God. Hurry up and go so that I can have MY turn?’ he mentally begged. “But, Bryce—“

“I can hold it still,” Bryce said. “Barely even have to go.” He released his cock for a second, then his eyes went wide as a spurt immediately seeped from his tip. Frantically, he grasped hold of himself again. “B—Barely need it!”

Kenneth jiggled up and down. His bladder was stinging, his long held urine burning down to his urethral opening and begging for release. “Bryce, I…” he lowered his voice to a whisper, in spite of their solitude. “I… I can’t go if I know someone is waiting on me to finish.”

Oh… Of course, it had to have been something like that. No way would Kenneth have earnestly given Bryce first-dibs on the restroom just out of the goodness of his heart. Still, now that Bryce’s competitive streak had been ignited, it wouldn’t fade so easily. He absolutely wasn’t gonna pee before Kenneth did. “Let’s just go together, then.”

“What?” Kenneth whined. He wanted that restroom all to HIMSELF while he used it! He could already feel his holding muscles tightening down. “But, WHY?”

“I changed my mind,” Bryce squeezed himself again. “I’m about to explode, YOU’RE also about to explode. If we’re both at the toilet, then we won’t need to worry about it.”

“But— I can’t— It’s not gonna come out…”

“I’ll only be in there until I’M finished,” Bryce said. “At least, this way, if you can’t wait for me to get done, you’ll be in the right spot, won’t you?”

Kenneth was certain now that Bryce just meant to torture him. To make him stand there and watch, his bladder roiling and refusing to cede, as Bryce claimed his relief quickly and easily right in front of him. To force him to listen to the harsh rush of his stream and the sighs that fell from his lips.

Jerk…

Bryce opened the door to the restroom, his bladder cramping and nearly causing him to go right there when he saw the toilet.

Kenneth whimpered at the sight too, scrambling in after Bryce. “You’re an asshole,” he said. “Why are you making me do this? I’m not gonna be able to…”

“You’ve gone in front of me before,” Bryce said, loosening his belt. “I’m sure you can manage it again.”

“But, you aren’t going to be… Doing…” Kenneth fumbled. He realized now that he wasn’t exactly sure WHAT to call the whole shoulder-rubbing-calm-down-thing. “You know, you aren’t going to be doing… The… Thing… That I need.”

“You can do it,” Bryce assured, lowering his zipper and aiming for the toilet.

Kenneth hurried to free himself as well, he knew the sound of Bryce’s release was likely to begin at any second, and if it DID make him leak, he at least didn’t want it to end up in his pants.

Once Kenneth was in the proper position to let his bladder flow, it didn’t. He’d expected that. Bryce didn’t start pissing either, which WAS surprising. He turned his head slightly, seeing the other gnashing his teeth and stomping his feet hard into the floor.

“N—Now YOU can’t go, either?” Kenneth huffed. This was pretty ridiculous. Bryce was apparently getting pee-shy now as well for some reason, and so they were both just going to stand there miserably and try to wait until ONE of them managed to get a stream started. All of which could be avoided if they simply TOOK TURNS like Kenneth had wanted to from the start!

“I—I’m waiting for you,” Bryce said.

For God’s sake…

“WHY?” Kenneth demanded. “We both could have peed already by now if you weren’t being so stupid!” His bladder was lurching around inside him, pulling at his taut skin. No matter how many times it chose to torture him in this way, Kenneth didn’t think he’d ever get over how agonizing it was to stand RIGHT THERE in front of a toilet, and not be able to use it. This was what he figured Purgatory must have been like…

Hss…

There was a sharp, quick trickle of liquid, and Kenneth looked down frantically. It didn’t feel like he was going, but sometimes he didn’t feel the relief until he’d been emptying for a few seconds. There was nothing pouring from his tip, though. And, just as quickly as the noise had begun, it ceased.

Bryce had just leaked a little…

“My God, Bryce… Just let it the Hell go,” Kenneth begged. “I feel like I’m gonna die.” Really, he felt like a hot poker was being shoved up into his urethra and twisted around inside of it, but that was too graphic even for someone like him, whom had an often vulgar mouth, to say.

“You first,” Bryce grunted, wrapping his hands tightly around his dick. One grasped the shaft and squeezed, while the other pinched against his opening. His hips twitched and bucked with needy spasms.

“Bryce… If this is you trying to compete with me, please stop? You already know that I can hold more,” Kenneth said. He rubbed a hand below his navel, tapping his fingers gently against his taut flesh, begging his body to let him go.

Bryce’s logical half acknowledged that Kenneth was right and only trying to hurry along his OWN relief. But, his competitive half was a lot less reasonable. It argued that Kenneth was TAUNTING him, reminding him that HE was superior! So, Bryce tensed his thighs together, and told himself to hold it.

“Bryce, pleaaase?” Kenneth begged, he’d started to hop up and down, even though he knew pee-dancing would only make it harder for him to go. It was just impossible to silence the angry yells from inside his body which commanded him to move! “Please, just go pee now? Please? It will feel better!” He realized he was voicing these pleas both to Bryce AND to his own locked up bladder. “Please?”

“You first.”

“I can’t,” Kenneth moaned. “You KNOW that! It won’t come out!” He screwed his eyes shut, bore down on his muscles as hard as he could, managing to grunt from the effort but NOT managing to let out even the smallest drop. He could feel Bryce’s eyes on him… Since his own were closed he didn’t even know if Bryce WAS looking at him, but he FELT like he was, and that was enough to plug him closed! “Just— Just— PLEASE?”

Bryce bit his tongue to keep himself from begging Kenneth in the same manner. His bladder was thrashing, wailing loudly inside him. Even with the stranglehold his had over his cock, a pale droplet was collecting on his tip. It fell with a quiet plink into the bowl, and another started to take its place. If Kenneth didn’t start peeing, maybe Bryce would empty himself out all the way drop by tiny, meager drop…

“Please,” Kenneth was babbling now, the need for relief overpowering him. He felt the pee pressing so hard against his sphincters, his bladder trying its hardest to push it out the rest of the way, but his muscles refused to cede no matter how much he wanted them to. “Please, Bryce… Just… Just pee now, okay? You’ll feel so much better if you just pee. Just— Just let it out, and— and you’ll feel… S—So wonderful. Your insides will stop hurting so bad. You’ll feel all hollow and empty and loose, and— And—“

Psssshhhhh!!!

A much louder hiss of liquid filled the room, and Kenneth blinked his eyes open. ‘Oh, thank God, he’s finally…’ A second later, he felt an immense drop in pressure in his middle, and realized that Bryce hadn’t started peeing.

HE had.

As soon as that sank in for him, Kenneth was moaning. “Ahhhhhhhhhhhh…”

“Oh, thank fuck…” Bryce muttered, loosening his own hold and releasing another loud jet of piss into the bowl. “Finallyyyy…”

Kenneth’s eyes fluttered closed and his mouth hung open as he let loose loud, incoherent noises of relief. The sound of both their emptying bladders echoed off the walls, but Kenneth was certain— and rather embarrassed— that HIS stream was the louder one. Once he was able to speak again, stricken as he was by the nearly orgasmic, pulsing haze overtaking all of his agony, Kenneth panted out; “You… Are… An… Asshole…”

Bryce blinked his eyes a bit, the euphoria slowly curing his desperation as more and more liquid pounded from his tip. “Hey… Got you to pee in front of me WITHOUT having to do the whole soothing thing first, right? That’s progress.”

“You… You and I both… Both know that’s not why you did this…” Kenneth’s chest was heaving up and down, he was going almost dizzy from how good everything felt. “Trying to… To outlast me…”

“And I DID,” Bryce said. “You went first.”

“I don’t freaking care…” Kenneth murmured. He didn’t. He didn’t care about anything except for how amazing it felt to pee. His spine shook with a long, hard shiver. 

Bryce’s stream ended first, even though he’d started second. That lessened his triumph a little bit, but Kenneth had been correct in saying he’d feel way better after he’d pissed. He tucked his member back into his pants and zipped them up, and now he was just… Alone in a room with Kenneth as the latter pissed a seemingly never-ending waterfall.

Bryce didn’t know why, but he sort of… Watched. Kenneth was too lost in his relief now to notice, his eyes had shut again. So, Bryce could get away with spectating. Kenneth was sort of…

No.

He wasn’t.

He was not.

Not in a million years.

No.

Kenneth’s hair was tousled, all out of place from all the frantic squirming he’d been doing. His face was pale and flushed, tinted pink with relief. His eyes closed so gently, his mouth hanging open, as he… Made… Those… Sounds…

And NONE of that was cute. Or— Or anything else, for that matter! It didn’t make Bryce feel anything at all.

Bryce’s eyes had been possessed by something. That was the only explanation for what happened next. He’d just lost control of them, they’d chosen all on their own to look down at Kenneth’s dick. Bryce certainly hadn’t told them to do that. And he definitely didn’t tell them to keep staring at it.

Bryce felt nothing looking at Kenneth’s penis. Absolutely nothing. He definitely didn’t immediately compare it to his own, or think ‘It looks better from this angle, instead of looking straight down at it when I help him piss.’ He didn’t wonder, even for the smallest fraction of a second, what Kenneth’s dick would feel like in his hand. And he DEFINITELY didn’t think about what it would be like having it somewhere else!

He didn’t. He didn’t. He just… Didn’t.

Kenneth was finally empty a few seconds later anyway, and Bryce snapped his head around so he was facing the wall instead. He listened to Kenneth zipping back up, listened to the other washing his hands off, and he definitely didn’t have a hard time thinking of something to say. He just chose to stay quiet because he wanted to, not because he was feeling something that was making him too confused to speak!

They left the restroom, finding Dwight had returned and was in one of the beds. “Were you guys seriously pissing the entire time I was gone?” he asked.

“Paulson had trouble,” Bryce said, glad to have his voice back… Not that he’d ever lost it, or anything! “As usual.”

“Bryce wouldn’t leave me alone!” Kenneth whined.

“You… You went though, right?” Dwight checked.

“Yeah. Better now,” Kenneth said.

“Good,” Dwight said.

Then, when it was time for bed, Bryce absolutely didn’t wish that Kenneth and Dwight would invite him to sleep with them again. He didn’t mind having one of the big beds all to himself. He didn’t feel cold and lonely at all.

When he finally fell asleep, his dream had absolutely NOTHING to do with Kenneth or Dwight. It certainly didn’t have them appear without clothes on at any point. And there were ZERO moments where one of them stroked Bryce’s length, none where Bryce sucked either of them off. There weren’t any moments where Elizabeth watched any of that happen. And at absolutely NO point did Kenneth tie Bryce to a bed, coyly brandish a whip, lean down next to him and speak the words “Beg me, Bryce… Beg me now…”

Morning dawned, and Bryce didn’t need to change his boxers right away for any reason in particular. He just wanted to. That was all.

Written for the Omovember prompt "Caught Peeing In A Strange Location".

***

Kenneth hated when The Leader sent a carriage to bring them to his villa. Kenneth didn’t like the cramped space, and he especially hated the bounciness. He only had to ride in them occasionally, only when he, Dwight and Bryce were visiting the villa AND it was pouring down rain like it was today. It was okay for them to walk through the rain other times, but not on their way to see The Leader, not when they could track mud and water into his quarters.

The rain was another thing Kenneth hated about riding in carriages, the continuous hiss and spattering of it against the roof, so loud and clear to his ears.

Because, whenever this situation came up and he had to reach the villa this way, Kenneth was guaranteed to have an extremely full bladder.

They’d catch the train, and he’d of course have to hold it all through the ride. And then, once they were at the station, he wouldn’t be able to go there either because there would always be such a large line of people looking for a place to warm up for a few minutes— Bryce wasn’t about to wait around in the rain for Kenneth to relieve himself, and Kenneth knew he wouldn’t be able to go with other people waiting on him. He also couldn’t resort to urinating in the bushes near the train station because Bryce would bark “Don’t you DARE go into all that mud! The Leader will be so angry if you show up with filthy boots!”

And Kenneth would understand that Bryce was right but… He’d just need to go so badly, and need someplace…

So, he’d have no choice but to board the carriage already desperate. He couldn’t stop at the shop along the way to the villa, the one where he’d successfully relieved himself several times in the past, because the carriage didn’t MAKE stops like that. He’d just have to sit there, wedged between Bryce and Dwight, squirming and jiggling. Sometimes, the rain would make Bryce start squirming too, and they'd wind up kicking each other over and over.

This particular voyage was shaping up to be one of Kenneth's worst.

The horses pulling this carriage didn’t seem very enthused about their jobs. They jerked around sometimes, the coachman having to steer them back, the uneven motion jostling Kenneth harshly and causing him to whimper as his legs crossed. Occasionally, the horses would just stop suddenly and make Kenneth’s bladder lurch. Every time a wheel went over a rock or bump, Kenneth would feel it. The tiniest pebble was enough to ignite his abdomen in pain.

 The rain was really coming down this time, too. Loud and torrential, and the way it sloshed onto the roof overhead sounded so much like pee pouring into a toilet that Kenneth could barely hold back his moans of displeasure. Sometimes, it was so bad that he had to lean forward and press a hand to his crotch, hoping that the coachman would not choose that exact second to turn around and look at him.

He’d actually USED to like carriage rides. He went on them with Mother sometimes when he was really little, and it had been a special treat since they didn’t have much money. Normally, they walked everywhere.

Back then, Kenneth had liked interacting with the horses, and the bouncy feeling had been fun, rather than simply agonizing as it drove thick spikes into his full bladder.

Now, he wanted to ask his friends how much further it was— Though, he knew the answer, having traveled this route many times. He wanted to tell Dwight how miserable he felt and seek some form of comfort from him. He couldn’t do either of these things, he didn’t dare say anything that could call attention to his need. The coachman would hear, and Kenneth didn’t know him. A stranger becoming aware that he was dying to piss would be far more than he could handle.

Dwight didn’t really need to be spoken to about it, anyway. Kenneth’s urgency was obvious to him. When he felt he could get away with it, he would rub his thumb against Kenneth’s hand in an attempt to reassure him that it would be okay.

Kenneth tried to distract himself for a little while, recalling carriage trips with his Mother. It had been neat to see his hometown through the window, the view from up high making him feel taller. Mother would be beside him and he always felt safe with her. She said things like “Your Father has things he needs to work through, don’t listen to what he says. He’s hurt, and so he wants to make us feel hurt, too.”

Kenneth hadn’t understood back then, whatever was making his Father feel bad, he didn’t see why it meant he had to be mean.

It was scary, but Kenneth did understand it now. He understood what it was like to feel so terrible that he just wanted to make someone else feel worse. That was the other side of him, the angry side, the side that wanted him to become his Father and the one he tried so hard not to let out. The side Dwight kept away…

Sometimes, when Kenneth rode the carriage with Mother, they didn’t talk about Father. Kenneth liked those times the best. It was fun to pretend it was just the two of them. Sometimes, Kenneth would hope that they’d go back home and find out Father had run away and they would never have to see him again.

There was one trip with Mother in which Kenneth… Had to go pee. Really, really, really bad. He went before leaving the house like Mother told him to, but he’d been so thirsty that day that it wasn’t long before he had to go again…

Remembering THAT trip made Kenneth clench his thighs together and wedge a hand into his mouth to chew on it. Looking back, he was pretty sure THAT day was his first real experience of being desperate to pee. He’d had close calls before, what young kid didn’t? But, those times he’d been close to a bathroom when he’d realized the urgency of his situation, and Mother always kept Father from denying him access to it.

THAT day was the first time he needed a toilet badly and there wasn’t one available. He wanted to STOP recalling that day, but faced as he was now with a vaguely similar situation, he couldn’t get rid of the memory now that it had started to replay.

Some things about it were strange to think about now. Before Mother died, before things with Father got so bad, Kenneth… Acted different. That day, he didn’t fidget miserably while chewing on his hands until Mother noticed his problem. Instead he’d just… Said it; “I have to pass water now, bad.” He’d just said it, out loud, and at a volume high enough for the coachman to hear. And he hadn’t cared. Hadn’t felt embarrassed…

And he didn’t think that the only cause for his change in attitude was just the fact that he was older now.

His Mother hadn’t gotten angry at him for needing to go. She sounded somewhat frustrated at first, but only for the smallest second. “I told you to do that before we— Oh, but you DID, didn’t you? I remember, you did listen,” she’d said. “You just had a lot of water this morning… ”

Young Kenneth had fidgeted. He was a little panicked when he realized the carriage wouldn’t have a toilet. “Where can I go?”

“When we’re at the shops, I’m sure one of them will have a bathroom for you. Just a few minutes, okay sweetie?”

Kenneth had nodded nervously. He was scared what would happen if he didn’t make it to the shops. He didn’t want to get the carriage all wet, the coachman would be mad at him. Mother probably would be too. Father got so mad when he wet his pants, Father hit him…

Kenneth had held it until they reached the shops. But then the first one didn’t have a bathroom, and the second one didn’t, either. The third one did, but not for customers. And at the fourth one, they would need to buy something first and all the food there was too fancy and expensive for them. Kenneth had been dancing around a lot by then, trying to tell his Mother that it was hurting him to keep waiting, but before he could get the words out, suddenly he wasn’t waiting anymore….

When he’d realized he was wetting himself, he started to cry very hard. He was sure Mother would punish him, even if she didn’t ever hit him like Father did, he was certain she was going to be angry now. But, she wasn’t. She’d hugged him tightly. “Shhh… No, it’s not your fault. You went right before we left, that’s all you could have done. We were looking for so long, it’s okay…”

She’d just… Held him, assured him it was alright, and that was the end of it.

How different would things be if he’d grown up only with his Mother? They would have been significantly poorer without a man in the household, but maybe Mother could have eventually found a new, different dad for Kenneth? One that would have been nice, like her? Would Kenneth be as prone to anger if he hadn’t been taught violence was the solution to every problem? Would he still have nightmares that made him wake up out of breath and covered in sweat? Would he… Would he be able to pee and voice his need to do so as easily and freely as Dwight could?

Kenneth shook his head and tried to stop his train of thought. He tried to focus on the feeling of Dwight’s hand touching his own. It was somewhat soothing, but the pangs in his bladder prevented him from truly relaxing.

Before long, every jolt of the carriage resulted in a sharp stab of pain flaring up Kenneth’s length. His holding muscles felt raw and irritated, his eyes welling up, like the pee was trying to find any possible escape route from his body. The rain just kept gushing…

“Paulson,” Bryce said. “You keep kicking me, and I... Don't want to be shoved around so much when it's raining. If you have to squirm, move closer to Smith.”

Kenneth blushed bright red, inching closer to Dwight. “Shhhh,” he hissed, but it was too late, the coachman had turned around.

The unknown man was staring straight at Kenneth now. And, as hard as he tried, Kenneth’s demanding bladder wouldn’t allow him to hold still under that gaze. “Ah, gotta use the toilet, huh?”

The rain had made Kenneth feel chilly, but now his embarrassment was making him feel like he was on the surface of the sun.

“How bad is it?”

Kenneth stayed absolutely silent. He was fluent in three languages and seemed to have spontaneously forgotten ALL of them. The only thing worse than the horrid pressure in his middle was the heat flaming through his chest, neck and face.

“Uh, he’s… Uh…” Dwight said, trying to think of something to say that WOULDN’T make Kenneth feel more humiliated than he already did.

The coachman shrugged. “Oh, never mind, I can tell you’re about ready to pop back there… Can’t imagine the rain’s helping you out too much.”

One of the horses jerked to the side again, Kenneth released a strangled cry as he thrust a hand to his lap, unable to stop either action.

“Aw, and these unruly beasts aren’t helpful either, are they?” the coachman guessed.

Kenneth clenched his jaw against the urge to shout at the man to be quiet. It was bad enough being desperate to pee, the added weight of all this self-consciousness was hurting him more than the rain AND the disobedient horses combined. His body grew even warmer as rage joined the mix of emotions he was battling with. ‘Don’t. Explode.’ he ordered himself, realizing a moment later that he’d probably meant that in TWO ways. ‘Don’t. Explode. Don’t yell, don’t scream, don’t curse. This man doesn’t even realize he’s humiliating you. It’s not on purpose. Don’t. Explode.’

Dwight put a hand on his shoulder, and some of the anger faded.

Bryce slowly reached to pat his other shoulder, and more of it went away. The rage now was replaced with surprise, Bryce had never managed to cool off his anger before, only ignite it further.

“I’ll see if I can get them to move a little faster,” the coachman said. “Sorry, I know how awful you must be feeling right now. Try and hang on, okay?”

‘This guy is only trying to help you,’ Kenneth kept repeating. ‘He feels sorry for you.’

‘Because you’re weak,” the voice of his Father crept into his mind. ‘And pathetic. And you can’t even hold your piss through a short ride like an adult.’

No. Not now. Not now. Kenneth was already so freaking miserable, bursting at the seams and so embarrassed that it was actually causing him physical pain. The last thing he needed was for that bastard to worm his way into his head from beyond the grave again.

‘Go away!’ Kenneth screamed inside his mind, squeezing his eyes shut as he stomped his feet. ‘You are DEAD. I KILLED you, like you deserved. Put you in the ground where you belong!’

‘Yep. Buried right next to HER,’ he imagined his Father saying.

Shit.

Father knew how to cut deep…

But this WASN’T his Father— Not his real Father, anyway. The man was DEAD. The version of him that popped into Kenneth’s head like this wasn’t real. He came from INSIDE Kenneth… He WAS Kenneth. He was the part of Kenneth that hated himself.

Dwight held Kenneth’s hand again, “You’re shaking…” he said quietly.

“Sorry…” Kenneth said. “Can you talk to me? I need a distraction.”

Dwight was sure that it was just his bladder Kenneth wanted a diversion from. “Okay,” Dwight said. He started talking to Kenneth about every random subject that popped into his mind, most of them were related to food.

Kenneth responded every so often, twisting his legs back and forth, his urgency building and building until he thought for sure he wouldn’t be able to handle it a second longer.

Even when the journey had nearly ended, Kenneth knew his ordeal was far from being over. He could never embarrass himself by sprinting straight to the toilet after he’d arrived. The last thing he ever, EVER wanted was for The Leader to know he really, really had to pee. He’d know right away if Kenneth rushed to the restroom immediately after greeting him.

That was another awful thing about taking the carriage, with no pee stops along the way, Kenneth would be required to stand and make polite conversation with The Leader until he finally felt he could take a break.

“Here we are,” the coachman announced finally. As he, Bryce and Dwight left the carriage, Kenneth sat there a moment longer, crossing his legs tightly as the pain in his bladder reached a new level. Unable to resist it any longer, he clasped his member tightly in both hands, struggling to hold back his flood. Finally, he managed to leave the carriage and found himself standing half-hunched over on the ground, shielded from the rain beneath the villa’s thick canopy— But, it still managed to penetrate his ear drums and send his bladder into an angry, wild frenzy of need.

He scrambled after the others to the door and jiggled up and down as he waited for it to be opened. A servant ushered them in. The coachman walked off on his own, and Kenneth, Dwight and Bryce were told where to wait. Kenneth was immensely relieved when he heard that, he wouldn’t need to meet The Leader right away today, perhaps there was enough time for him to use the restroom first…

He, of course, knew he didn’t do well ‘under pressure’ like that, and worrying that The Leader could arrive before he’d finished urinating was sure to create a problem for him, but he felt reasonably sure he’d be able to get some relief.

Kenneth walked down the hall he knew led to the toilet, body already going loose with anticipation.

Except, when he got to the restroom, he found the coachman and a servant were discussing something just a few paces from the door. Kenneth cringed and bobbed on his feet. He couldn’t go if he could hear people talking on the other side of the door. Even quiet, muffled voices were too intimidating for his scared, timid bladder.

His mind moved at a rapid pace. He could request that they take their conversation elsewhere. But… Then they’d ask why! And he’d have to say “I need to pee, and I can’t go if I can hear you talking!”

Unacceptable.

He could wait for them to leave, but who knew how long those two were going to stand around talking? The Leader was due to appear soon! Kenneth couldn’t risk being late.

He could just hold it and go back to the main room. This was the idea he liked the least. He had to go! Speaking with The Leader could take ages, and he’d be twitching and bouncing and squirming the whole time. How humiliating!

Kenneth didn’t know WHAT he could do, and his bladder kept boiling away inside him the longer he simply STOOD there, mere feet from the toilet he already knew that he couldn’t use.

He ended up walking PAST the bathroom, ignoring a series of very urgent, confused pangs from within his bladder. Kenneth wasn’t sure where he was going now. He knew that was the only toilet here, save for the one in The Leader’s private quarters, and he’d need special permission to use that one.

He found himself at the door to one of the guest rooms. He ducked inside, wondering if perhaps having a quiet place to consider all of his options would help. He KNEW what he should do; He should just go ask the servant and coachman to stand further from the restroom so he could please use it. But, just the thought was making him shudder with embarrassment.

His bladder shuddered too, recognizing the fact he was now alone in a room, all by himself. The simple solitude was enough to send a strangled spurt of urine into his boxers, the tip of his penis feeling warm and sodden as it rubbed against the wet spot. Panicked, he gripped himself firmly with one hand while the other struggled to unclasp his belt. With quite a bit of agonizing clenching and squirming, he managed to stem the leak and release the tight strap of his belt from the stranglehold it had on his bladder.

There was a bit of relief then, but it lasted only a second before the painful, urgent pangs were back in full force. He stomped in place. “Nnnh, just go ask them to move!” he pleaded with himself. “You’re gonna wet yourself otherwise!” That would be much worse! He was behaving illogically, and he knew it. He just… He couldn’t bring himself to tell two strangers about his problem. He couldn’t do it…

He spotted two things in rapid succession. The first was the decorative vase in one corner, and the second was the large wardrobe.

‘Paulson. No,’ Kenneth ground his teeth together against the absolutely horrible idea that spontaneously appeared to him. ‘Don’t you dare. No. Just ask them to move. That’s all you have to do!’

He bent forward slightly when another heavy wave of need flared through his bladder. IT thought Kenneth’s new idea was absolutely terrific and could come up with zero reason that he shouldn’t act upon it.

‘Gah! No! What would The Leader say if you did that!?’ Kenneth asked himself. He pictured the man spotting Kenneth trying to take the vase outside to empty it, a look of pure revulsion crossing his features when he immediately realized what it was full of.

‘There is a window here, though,’ Kenneth thought. ‘You can go in the vase, then open the window and dump it out without having to walk by anybody with it.’

‘Well, what would Dwight say th— Oh, forget it, he’d probably encourage you! He’d say “Go ahead, Kenneth. Just let it out here. You’re hurting yourself!” Bryce would be mad, though. He’d say “Why the Hell couldn’t you just ask them to give you privacy like a normal person!?”’

Kenneth bounced on his heels in indecision, hands squeezing away at his dick. He didn’t dare to let go of himself, his bladder was starting to really weaken now that he was both ALONE and had an idea of how he could relieve himself here.

‘Wha—What would your MOTHER say!?’ Kenneth scolded himself. ‘Mother wanted you to be polite! She would never, EVER tell you that it’s okay to pee into a vase just because you’re too freaking shy to—‘

Another memory came to Kenneth. A time when his Mother DID encourage him to pee somewhere other than a toilet. It was a day when his Father was being particularly awful to both of them, raging through the house. Kenneth and his Mother had hidden themselves from his anger in his parents’ bedroom. Kenneth was much too scared to leave that room for anything, but… He needed to go really, really bad!

He was also too scared to talk and tell his Mother what was wrong. Only whimpering and squirming. Which she thought were just indications he was afraid. But, before long, he’d ended up holding onto his front and that made it pretty obvious.

“Shhh, shhh, shh…” Mother had soothed him. “Kenny, do you need to pass water?”

Mother was the only person who’d ever called him Kenny. It was her special name for him. No one else was allowed to use it.

Kenneth had nodded, miserable with need.

Mother could still hear Father moving around, knew he was still awake and looking for a fight… She couldn’t force Kenneth out there to use the toilet. He probably wouldn’t even make it there before Father decided to take out all his frustration on him.

Mother had looked around the room instead. There was a towel on the floor, the only thing she thought might work… “Okay, Kenny. I’ll hold this towel over you, and you can go into it.”

“I don’t want to make a mess,” Kenneth said. “I’m only supposed to go in the toilet.”

“It’s okay this time,” Mother assured him. “I promise. You won’t be in trouble.”

Kenneth recalled how it had taken a few minutes of convincing before he’d agreed that the towel was an alright spot to relieve his bladder.

Mother would probably be okay with him filling the vase now then, right?

‘Maybe they aren’t even by the door anymore, though. At least go check first!’ Kenneth took one step, beginning to exit the room, and his bladder surged so powerfully that a slosh of pee splashed into his boxers, re-soaking the drying wet patch and making him burn with humiliation and grit his teeth in pain. He hopped in place, shifting his weight all around, and just barely managed to stop himself from letting out any more.

Vase it was, then.

Crossing his legs so tight he felt them going numb, Kenneth made himself bend down and pick the vase up. It was large enough that he couldn’t grab it with a single hand, meaning he had to let go of his crotch to do it, which immediately prompted another slow, dribbling leak.

He took several comically doubled over, tiny steps over to the wardrobe and drew it open with his foot. He stepped inside and let the door shut behind him. He was struck then by how cramped and dark it was inside the wardrobe. He knew he should have expected it, but it was still making his skin feel warm and itchy.

He set the vase down, then opened the door up a crack, just to remind himself that he wasn’t trapped in here, before shutting it again.

Privacy, at last.

His bladder realized that fact immediately, letting go a few more threads and trickles down his legs. “Ah—!” he choked out around his panic. He just had to get his clothes undone, he could feel a very frightening amount of dampness between his legs, flowing down the insides of his thighs. Fighting to stop leaking, he at last managed to get his zipper down, pulling his damp member out and aiming the dripping thing for the opening of the vase.

Instantly, his straining muscles relaxed, unable to withstand the pressure a second longer. A long, ferocious jet of clear urine erupted from his tip and sprayed into the vase. His eyelids fluttered as he went light from the release of so much tension. “Hahhhh…” he moaned, unable to hold back the sound any more than he could hold back his pee.

He was pissing so intensely that he couldn’t even stand up straight, the heaviness of his relief was making his legs go weak and wobbly. He gasped and panted, feeling almost dazed from how much better he felt now that he was finally allowed to empty out.

Kenneth was lost in a haze of bliss when he heard a creaking noise, he tensed slightly, but not enough that he stopped pissing. Now that the dam had burst, it seemed there was no way to put it back together agai—

“What are—“

But, then he heard a voice and saw light spilling into the wardrobe, and it was like a cork had been shoved into him. Everything stopped, his flow ceased immediately, unbelievable amounts of relief turning into agony that was even worse than what he’d been feeling in the seconds before he’d begun peeing.

Kenneth’s first reaction to having his release so cruelly taken away was to moan “Nnnnh!” and stomp his feet against the ground.

“Wh—What are you doing?” the voice asked again.

“Get out!” Kenneth pleaded, not daring to turn around and see WHO exactly had spotted him. It wasn’t Dwight’s voice, nor Bryce’s. And he thanked God that it wasn’t The Leader’s… But all that meant a stranger had caught him at this most personal and private of moments. “G—Get out! Please? I’m not— I’m not done!”

The door to the wardrobe didn’t close. The jerk was still here… Why? Wasn’t it bad enough he’d walked in on Kenneth relieving himself in such an unconventional way? Didn’t he have enough to go tell all his friends about now? Couldn’t he at least let Kenneth finish what he’d started? Dear God, his holding muscles were BURNING. It hurt so, so bad!

“Get out!” Kenneth repeated, trying his best to summon his firm ‘don’t you dare fuck with me’ voice, but having a hard time finding it when he was in so much pain.

“Why are you— Could you not find the toilet? Come on, I’ll show you. You should have mentioned you didn’t know where it was while we were in the carriage!”

Oh. Now Kenneth recognized the voice. It was the coachman. He turned his head slightly to look at the man, whom was gazing back directly at him. He’d seen… Everything, hadn’t he? “N—No, that’s not it… I just— Really, really have to be alone right now, okay? Please? I still haven’t finished, and I’m embarrassed enough. Just leave.”

“I guess if you can’t walk, that’s alright. But, you should have—“

“Please, for the love of God, stop talking and go!” Kenneth snapped, rage now burning as much as his muscles were. He felt dangerously close to exploding— And not in the way he WANTED to. “I can’t— If you’re here, I can’t go, and it hurts! That’s why I had to do it in here! Because you and that servant were talking right in front of the bathroom!”

The coachman was quiet for a moment, and then “Ohhhhh! You— You, too?”

He just kept on talking! If Kenneth didn’t need both hands to be covering up his member right now, he’d probably try to strangle the guy! “Please. Leave,” he gritted out.

“But, I just— I’ve always thought I was the only person with that problem,” the coachman said.

Kenneth did not immediately bark another order for the man to leave. For a second, he felt too surprised to do that. He’d sort of believed HE was the only person with his… particular issue, as well. “I don’t wanna talk about it right now! If—If you have this problem, then you know how much it’s hurting me right now! Please, go away!”

“Oh, right,” the coachman said.

And, finally, the door was closed again, and Kenneth heard the guy leave the room, and at last his bladder had resumed emptying itself. “Ahhhh…” Kenneth let his eyelids fall closed, a shiver working up his back as he finally finished up.

He zipped his pants and re-affixed his belt, then carefully picked up the vase. He winced at the smell of his urine, and at how warm the vase now felt in his arms. Very, very slowly he moved to the window. Setting the vase back down, he got it opened and finally poured the contents out into the grass below. He cringed, unable to believe he’d just done all of that.

And… Fuck, that guy had seen. Had seen AND talked to him about it…

Kenneth left the room. He’d need to give the vase a proper wash later, just to be safe, but he was reasonably sure no one would be able to tell it had pissed in right now. As soon as he was back in the hallway, the coachman was by his side. “Wow, you must be feeling better now, huh?” he asked.

“Please stop talking to me.” Kenneth looked away. He had thoroughly humiliated himself before this man, he just wished the guy would drop it and pretend it had never happened! That was what a normal person would do!

“How long have you had the pissing problem?” the coachman asked, somehow still unable to take the very, very obvious hint. “For me, it started when I went to school for the first time. The schoolhouse just had one long urinal for the boys, and I couldn’t go. The others noticed and started teasing me, and I just kept thinking about—“

Kenneth heaved a heavy sigh. “The Leader is probably waiting for me, so—“

“And, nobody expects me to be like this, because I’m not normally shy. I talk to everybody, and I’m open— I’m even open about having this problem, I let people know about it so they’ll be aware I need extra time and privacy. Everybody thinks I’m really weird, because they don’t get frozen up, so they don’t know what it’s like.”

Kenneth did not enjoy TELLING people unless he absolutely HAD to. “I… I don’t… I don’t tell people. Nobody else needs to know about it.”

“Well, if you’d told ME then you wouldn’t have needed to pee in a vase,” the coachman pointed out.

Kenneth frowned, looked at his feet. That was true…

“But, it’s okay. I’ve done weird stuff because of my problem, too,” the coachman said. “One time, I had to go really bad, except the bathroom was really crowded. But, there was a lake outside, so I pretended to fall into it so I could pee there without anyone knowing.”

Kenneth groaned. He knew this guy was… Trying to be supportive, so he tried not to get too angry. He just wanted to talk about literally anything else. “I have to— The Leader will be out soon. I have to see him.”

“Oh, okay,” the man said. “If you want to talk later though, we can!”

Kenneth doubted he’d take him up on that offer.

Then again, would it really be SO terrible to know someone who completely understood what living with this issue was like?

Written for the Omovember prompt "In Front Of A Crush".

***

Elizabeth had specifically asked for Bryce to visit her in the medical building today! He was so excited and full of energy that he decided to RUN there at breakneck speed… But, the rain from the last several days had still been pouring, the ground slick with watery mud, and Bryce’s glasses becoming fogged and dotted with droplets.

He slipped.

Pretty badly.

He landed flat on his back in the mud, one of his legs twisting painfully enough that he yelped.

Right in front of the medical building.

Right in front of Elizabeth.

So, NOW he was visiting with her for a very different reason.

“Oh, poor Bryce…” Elizabeth said, helping him back up.

Once on his feet, Bryce received a reminder of the OTHER reason he’d been in such a hurry to get to this building; Nothing was worse on Bryce’s bladder than a rainstorm; The constant gushing, rushing hiss of thousands of streams plummeting to the ground never failed to make him want to go. And, he REALLY wanted to go now.

Bryce bounced on his heels, but cringed when a horrid slice of pain rocketed up his injured leg.

“Careful steps now,” Elizabeth encouraged. “Lean against me.”

Bryce obeyed. It felt really good to press himself into her, but his bladder was still throbbing with tension. This was ridiculous! He’d relieved himself only half an hour ago, he wished his bladder wasn’t so sensitive to running water! It felt like every drop falling from the sky was somehow ending up inside him!

And now that he was hurt, Elizabeth was sure to fuss over him… Which, he supposed wouldn’t have been THAT terrible if there wasn’t something else that he needed to be doing.

Elizabeth helped him into the building, and now that they were out of the storm, she could see one of his pant-legs was ripped up, exposing some gashes in his leg from where he’d fallen. She wrinkled her brow. “Oh, that doesn’t look good,” she said.

Bryce forced himself to stand up straighter. His injured leg screamed, just not as loudly as the piss inside him. “N—No, it’s okay. I’ve had worse.”

“You’re bleeding,” Elizabeth told him. “Those are some deep cuts. You don’t want an infection, do you?”

“No,” Bryce admitted. He could hear the rain pounding against the roof, the sloshing going straight to his bladder. This wasn’t good. He was soaked through with rain, freezing cold from being out in the downpour, his leg badly hurt and wanting to pee on top of all that wasn’t helping with any of it.

Before, he’d been planning to sneak off to the toilet before meeting with Elizabeth, foregoing the embarrassment of having to tell her that he wanted to relieve himself. And, if that hadn’t worked out, he’d intended to wait for her to get distracted by a patient for a second, and then say he needed to ‘check on something’, still easily avoiding having to tell her that he was currently full of piss.

But, now he WAS her patient, and her attention was going to remain fixed on him. Heat and pressure bloomed in his chest. His choices now were to either hold it in, or tell Elizabeth he wanted a toilet break.

Of course, Bryce was just going to have to hold it.

“Mmm,” Elizabeth murmured. “I don’t think it’s severe enough I need to give you a bed here… Come with me.”

Pressing his thighs together, Bryce hesitantly allowed Elizabeth to lead him down a short hallway. He realized after a moment that she was actually taking him to the restroom, and the blush spread up to his face. Had she been able to tell somehow? Bryce had thought he’d been doing a good job at concealing his desire to urinate. He hadn’t been crossing his legs… Granted, doing THAT right now would probably hurt pretty badly.

When she opened the door and told him to go in, the unpleasant, squirming warmth that had been radiating inside him grew even stronger. He didn’t want her telling him to go pee, thinking that he couldn’t wait… “I don’t need to go,” he told her. And that was true, he didn’t need to go. He just wanted to go. Really, really badly. Those were two different things.

“Heh, not for that,” Elizabeth laughed. “I was just gonna put some medicine on those cuts.” She took his arm again and helped him inside. “Sit down,” she instructed.

Bryce looked around. The only place to sit was on the lidless toilet. His bladder was cramping hard at the sight of it, since there wasn’t even a lid shielding the bowl, his body was certain that it was time to release now. He palmed his crotch for a moment while Elizabeth had her back turned. She couldn’t be asking for him to sit THERE, right?

“Oh, and pull your pants down first,” Elizabeth added.

Oh, God… WHAT?

“Dear, try not to be so embarrassed. Just your pants,” Elizabeth said. “Leave your boxers on. I just need to be able to get to your cuts. Pull them down and sit on the toilet, I’ll have you all cleaned and bandaged really fast.”

She DID want him to sit on the toilet. With his pants down, no less!

Shaking with embarrassment, Bryce slowly unzipped his pants. The sound of his zipper being pulled, a noise that so often came directly before he started to pee, was like a siren song to his bladder. It convulsed hard inside him, a flare of need traveling down his length. He grimaced hard, gnashing his teeth. He really wanted to grab himself again, but now Elizabeth was looking…

“I’ll turn around while you take them off,” Elizabeth said. “Would that help you feel better?”

Bryce nodded. ‘Please, please turn around! I want to hold myself…’

She turned, and Bryce immediately gave his crotch a nice, firm squeeze. The relief of that was enough to draw a sigh from his lips, but all too quickly, he had to let go so he could finish taking off his pants.

THIS was a torment to his bladder as well. Since he so often sat down to pee, baring his legs like this inside a restroom was ANOTHER cue that he was about to let go. His body just couldn’t grasp that, in spite of where he was and how much he had disrobed, he wasn’t going to pee any time soon.

Finally, Bryce looked at the toilet. He could scarcely imagine what seating himself down on that thing was going to do to him. Maybe if it had a lid, he could pretend to himself that it was a normal chair, but no. He was going to have to sit directly on a toilet seat while continuing to hold back his torrent.

He could simply TELL Elizabeth something like “Oh, you know what? Being in here is kinda making me need to go a little, after all! Could I please have some privacy for a minute?” If he said that, she’d have no idea that he was actually… Maybe… Kind of… A little bit desperate to go. She’d believe him that it had just come on suddenly, a natural response to being inside a restroom.

That was all he needed to say! And then he’d have the room to himself, and he could unload all the liquid he was restraining. It would be so easy!

Except. before Bryce worked up the nerve to tell her, Elizabeth had turned back around. “Go ahead,” she said. “I know it’s embarrassing, just pretend it’s a chair.”

“O—Okay,” Bryce blushed hard and anxiously sat down on the toilet.

And… Holy fuck… Bryce’s bladder felt like it was being snapped in half! He was sitting on a toilet seat, the bowl right underneath him. He could feel the cold porcelain against his thighs even through his boxers, all the familiar tactile sensations that told him it was safe to pee. But, his boxers were still up, still in the way, still about to get drenched should he relax himself even the tiniest bit… And Elizabeth was still here, and he had to hold it. He had to hold it. He had to hold it! Even though it hurt really, really badly. Even if the pain in his abdomen was far outweighing the ache in his leg. He had to hold it. Don’t let it out, don’t let it out, don’t let it out!

Bryce’s face scrunched up, his mouth twisting into a grimace and his eyes screwing shut. He just had to forget where he was. Had to convince himself that he wasn’t on the toilet. He was somewhere else. Somewhere with no restrooms, or bushes, or bottles. Nowhere to pee, so he just had to wait.

Elizabeth frowned at the pain present in Bryce’s features. “It’s alright,” she told him. “That was a bad fall, but I’ll make your leg stop hurting.”

Bryce could barely even FEEL his leg anymore. All he could feel were the oceans of pee colliding inside his bladder, the quivering in his sphincters as the urine desperately tried to flow through them. He tensed his thighs, since it was all he could do to alleviate the pressure. “Please, hurry?” he asked, his voice sounding utterly pitiful even to himself.

Elizabeth reached into the cabinet below the sink. She withdrew a bottle of medicine and some cotton balls. “I’m sorry, this might sting some,” she warned him.

Bryce didn’t think anything could possibly sting as badly as his urethra was, straining hard against a wave of barely contained piss. “Just hurry…” he repeated. Unable to stop himself, he started to shift around on his seat, rocking from side to side. All this did was irritate his bladder further, the liquid inside of it being sloshed back and forth with the motion.

“Try and hold still, okay?” Elizabeth encouraged, kneeling down in front of him. “I’m just going to put a little medicine on you now…”

With a loud boom of thunder, the noise of the rain pelting down increased dramatically. Bryce shuddered at the sound. A wave of desperation hit him as the rain hissed away and Elizabeth dabbed the medicine against his cut. She was right, it did sting, quite a lot. “Nnnh!” he kicked his other leg out from the discomfort. It wasn’t just the pain of the medicine being applied, it was the way the rest of his body RESPONDED to that pain.

His muscles all went taut, and squeezed in around his bladder, like it was caught inside a juicer. He instinctively grabbed onto his dick again when he felt a drip beading at his tip. He was too late, and he felt it seep into his boxers anyway.

“Shhh,” Elizabeth said. “I know, it hurts… But, it will help your cuts stay clean.” She started to dab around another cut, and Bryce became more accustomed to how that felt. His bladder kept lurching every time he felt the burn in his leg, but he didn’t lose any more drops.

But, then Elizabeth moved onto his deepest cut, and the pain of the medication being smeared into the slice made him suddenly collapse back in pain. The only thing worse than the medicine was how furiously his abdominal muscles dug into his bladder, and—

Elizabeth froze when she heard the sound of liquid trickling against liquid, punctuated by a tiny hiss that didn’t sound like it was coming from outside. It took her longer than it should have to figure out what the noise had been, but then she said “O—Oh dear… Do you… Actually need to USE that toilet right now, Bryce?”

Bryce nodded, blushing furiously. He couldn’t speak, he couldn’t hold it, and he COULDN’T let himself have an accident when he was literally sitting on a toilet!

Elizabeth felt silly asking this next question, the leak she’d just heard should have been answer enough. “Can you wait until I finish with your leg?”

Bryce was shaking his head wildly, face going redder and redder, and when another spurt dribbled into the bowl his eyes blew wide open.

“Okay,” Elizabeth said. “That’s fine. You should have just told me that you needed to go. Do you need help getting up for a second?”

Bryce DID need help standing up, and not just because of his hurt leg. His bladder had no room left inside of it, even the smallest motions made it roll over and slam itself against the walls of his body. He was going to burst if he stood up. He didn’t think he COULD stand up. Even with help, he doubted it was possible.

Bryce shook his head, “N—No,” he managed. Because if Elizabeth tried to move him right now, he knew he’d likely just explode. “I’ll just…” he spread his thighs apart, rolled up one of the legs on his boxers and gently positioned his member so it was now pointing down into the bowl. He did this sometimes if he had to pee in the middle of the night and he thought it would be too cold to pull his boxers down. A jet of pee erupted from him as soon as the fabric was out of his way, he cringed and clamped off his flow anyway. ‘Don’t pee in front of her!’ he begged himself. ‘Not again! Hold it!’ He managed to keep the remainder of his flood at bay for a second, long enough to squeak out “Could y—“

But that was it, then he was gushing uncontrollably, his stream loudly slamming into the water beneath him, and there was nothing he could do to make it stop. “A—Ah—Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh…..” Bryce’s panicked yelp transformed into a relaxed, pleased moan when the relief overtook all other stimuli. Finally, he was pissing for all he was worth, his painfully inflated bladder shrinking away to nothing.

At first, Elizabeth thought he was wetting himself on the toilet, but he seemed a bit TOO happy right now for that to be the case. She realized that he’d lifted one of the legs of his boxers so that the material wouldn’t get hit by his stream, and then just let it go. That was an…Interesting way to piss. Not that she’d spent much time observing anybody’s pissing habits.

She had to admit she didn’t exactly mind observing Bryce’s right now, though. It was nice to see him look a little bit less stiff and uptight for once. Instead, just slumping over and doing what came naturally.

But, another thing that came naturally to Bryce was the apology he was firing off once a few seconds had passed and the relief was no longer as mind-numbing. “Elizabeth— I’m— I’m sorry! I— I can’t believe I’m— I should have waited, I just couldn’t!”

“Bryce, it’s okay,” Elizabeth said gently. “I’ve seen people pee before. I’ve seen YOU pee before. It isn’t a big deal.”

Bryce’s bladder kept pouring, even when the embarrassment tinged his cheeks pink and made his spine stiffen, his stream didn’t slow down at all. If anything, it only got more powerful. His face heated up as Elizabeth just kept standing there beside him, the room silent save for the furious rush of his pee. “I’m sorry…” he repeated. “Almost done.”

That was a complete lie, as he didn’t feel even close to empty. He liked having a large bladder most of the time, but when he was awkwardly sitting there, waiting for it to drain out so that Elizabeth wouldn’t be listening to him gush anymore, he wished it were a little smaller.

Making him blush even more, Elizabeth said “It’s okay, take your time.”

To Bryce’s dismay, he DID end up taking his time. Even as forceful as his stream was, there had just been SO MUCH inside his bladder that it took FOREVER for him to get finished. When the final drops had seeped from his urethra, he kept sitting there and shuddering.

After a few solid seconds without any hissing noises, Elizabeth asked “Done?”

Bryce nodded timidly. “I’m so sorry…” he said again.

“It’s okay…” Elizabeth promised. “I’m not offended just because you needed to pee really badly. I just wish you’d SAID something about it sooner.”

“I… I had to go since I came here,” Bryce admitted. “That’s part of why I was running… The rain, it… It bothers me.”

Elizabeth frowned. Bryce had actually managed to injure himself because he hadn’t relieved his bladder before it became an emergency. And then he’d decided to CONTINUE holding it even after that. “Bryce, can you please TELL me if you need the toilet?” she requested. “I understand feeling embarrassed, but I was trying to help you today, and I didn’t realize I was just making you suffer.”

“Y—You weren’t making me suffer,” Bryce promised. “The medicine hurts, but—“

“I was causing you to hold your bladder. Because I didn’t know you WERE holding it. I thought you were squirming because of your leg.”

“I’m sorry…” Bryce said. “I don’t want you to worry.”

 “I won’t if you promise to tell me when you need something,” Elizabeth said. “I don’t like it when someone doesn’t communicate with me. Especially if it’s important.”

“Eheh,” Bryce rubbed the back of his neck. “Um… It was just peeing. It’s not that important.”

“That looked like it was pretty important,” Elizabeth said. “You needed that awfully bad.”

“Er… I could have—“

“Don’t you DARE try to tell me you could have waited,” Elizabeth said. “I asked you if you could hang on until I’d bandaged your leg, and you completely panicked. You couldn’t even wait for me to leave the room before you went.”

Bryce stared down at his lap. He felt like he was under a spotlight. “Alright…” he sighed. “Alright… I… I was bursting. And, if I’m ever bursting again, I’ll tell you.”

“Thank you,” Elizabeth said.

Bryce kept blushing. God, why was he… Why was he feeling so— He was so humiliated, but there was something underneath the embarrassment. A funny, little tingle. Elizabeth was scolding him, being so firm with him. Fuck no, he wasn’t supposed to be having these feelings when he was in the real world, when he was with the people he actually KNEW. He was only supposed to have them when he visited his secret club and fooled around for a night. The feelings were supposed to stay there, they were not allowed to follow him outside.

Elizabeth finished cleaning Bryce’s cuts and started to wrap a bandage around his leg. All the while, Bryce was fighting his imagination. ‘Bryce, I told you that you have to tell me when you need to pee…’ The Elizabeth in his daydream chided. ‘Now look at yourself, you’re so desperate you can hardly even walk… If you don’t learn to start listening to your body, maybe I should make you have an accident…’

Shitshitshit… Pee stuff had never, ever been a factor in any of his fantasies before. It had never been a factor in any of the things he explored at that club. Yes, he knew there were people in the club who… Enjoyed things relating to urination, but Bryce was not one of them. He didn’t like holding his pee, or… Or proving to himself that he could withstand his need for ages and ages.

He did DO that an awful lot though, didn’t he? Especially for someone who ‘didn’t like it’…

But, holding it hurt! And it wasn’t like being whipped, where beneath all the pain there was an intense thrill of showing himself and whoever was whipping him just how much he could take! Not at all!

‘Oh, wow,’ he pictured Elizabeth saying. ‘That’s so much! How did you ever fit all of that inside you? Poor Bryce, he’s getting so, so wet with all that pee, isn’t he?’

‘WHAT. THE. FUCK,’ Bryce shook his head frantically, trying to clear away those thoughts.

Elizabeth had finished with the bandage. “There we are,” she said, helping Bryce stand up again. He cringed, there was some dampness at the back of his boxers. When he lifted one leg up while sitting to piss during the night, he was never very desperate to go. He’d just let out a trickle, there wouldn’t be splashback to worry about hitting his clothes. This time had been different, he’d pissed violently and forcefully and some of it had sloshed back onto him.

He pulled his pants up, zipped them, and hoped Elizabeth hadn’t seen the damp spot.

“Feeling more comfortable now?” Elizabeth asked.

“Y—Yes…” Bryce lied. He wasn’t comfortable, his imagination in the last several minutes had made him EXTREMELY uncomfortable. ‘Calm down,’ he begged himself. ‘You— You’ve ALWAYS been interested in… Unusual things. You like ropes. You like whips. You once jacked off while imagining someone forcing you to swim through glue for some fucking reason. If THIS gets added to the list, it won’t even be the strangest thing on it! Why are you freaking out?’

When he fantasized about his other kinks, he didn’t involve people that he knew outside the club.

This was the first time he’d seriously thought about doing something so kinky with a person who was part of his every day life.

‘That’s… Probably not too bad. Elizabeth’s always made you feel funny, at least it was just her and not—‘

‘Bryce, that is pathetic!’ Bryce’s train of thought was suddenly interrupted when Kenneth suddenly popped into his mind’s eye. He was wearing an extremely revealing rubber and latex suit for some reason and brandishing a whip. ‘I can’t believe you’d pee yourself after just six hours of waiting! How utterly humiliating for you! I’m going to have to teach you a lesson!’

‘That’s right, Bryce!’ a dream-version of Dwight said. He too was wearing the same latex outfit. ‘Over Kenneth’s knee now!’

‘Ohh, poor Bryce!’ dream-Elizabeth cooed. ‘I told him to start listening to his bladder! He really DOES need a lesson!’

“Bryce…?” the real Elizabeth asked. “You are looking a little pale… Are you sure you’re feeling better?”

Bryce felt like he was going to either hyperventilate or spring an erection. Maybe both.

***

Dwight was in such a rush to get back to his barrack. He hadn’t been able to take a leak all day! Bryce had ordered him to sort things in one of the supply rooms again, and the restroom in that building had been out of order. Naturally, he’d tried to just pee outside instead, only for one of his other superiors to stop him and order him to finish his work before he left. “I’ll only be a minute!” he’d tried to argue. But, it hadn’t worked. Even Bryce talking to the other man and explaining that Dwight just needed a moment to relieve himself hadn’t gotten him a break.

Once he was finally dismissed, he’d intended to piss as soon as he was a few steps away from the building, but then when he’d gripped his zipper, it had refused to budge no matter how hard he fought with it.

So, that was why he was dying to get back to the barrack so that Kenneth could help him. His bladder was boiling away inside him, this was way, WAY longer than he was used to holding it for! His body was utterly confused why all this pee was still inside of it, it recognized he was outside, where he could go wherever he wanted. It didn’t understand concepts like ‘zippers’.

He made it to the barrack, and was happy to see Kenneth was already there… And looking unusually relaxed, so he’d probably just finished pissing out the entirety of today’s urine a little bit ago.

Kenneth glanced at Dwight for a second, noticing the hands clutching between his legs and the way his knees were knocking. “I don’t need it, you go ahead,” he said dismissively, waving in the direction of the restroom.

“I—“ Dwight hopped urgently on his feet. “Kenneth, I need to pee sooo bad!”

“I know,” Kenneth shrugged. “And I mean it, you can go now.”

Dwight’s grip on his dick tightened when he felt a few errant dribbles seep into his boxers. “But, Kenneth—“

“Seriously, don’t worry about me. You aren’t gonna be forcing me to hold it, just—“

“My zipper is stuck!” Dwight exclaimed, his bouncing increasing in speed as he tried to ignore the warmth he felt within his cupped palms.

Kenneth stared at his coiled up, squirming friend. “Oh…” he said. “You want some help?”

“Yesss!” Dwight hissed. “Please hurry? I haven’t gone at ALL today!”

Kenneth’s eyes widened. It was a wonder Dwight was still holding it when it had been THAT long. He hurried over to his friend’s side. “I’ll get it,” he promised, ushering him into the restroom.

Dwight groaned and whimpered in protest. He didn’t want to have to look at the toilet the whole time!

“This way, you’ll be able to go the SECOND I get you out,” Kenneth reasoned. “And, I promise, I’ll have you out really fast!” He brushed Dwight’s hands aside gently, and Dwight reluctantly complied with that even though it made his need to go so much stronger.

When Kenneth’s knuckles accidentally grazed against the hard stone of Dwight’s middle, however, Dwight couldn’t help but react. He jerked backwards, accidentally sucking in his stomach and pulling his skin tightly around his aching bladder. “Ahhh—- Oh my Goddddd, I need to gooooo!”

“S—Sorry,” Kenneth said quickly. “I didn’t mean to press there!” At least, with Dwight being so vocal, Kenneth was sure to be alerted if he made that mistake again…

“I—It’s okay,” Dwight said, clasping his hands behind his back so that he wouldn’t grab himself again. “J—Just please hurry, okay? I need to go really, really bad!”

“I know…” Kenneth mumbled, returning to Dwight’s zipper. At least, now that Dwight had started babbling about his urgency, he seemed to be fidgeting around a little less. That made Kenneth’s job easier, made him less likely to accidentally poke his friend’s bladder again.

“Gotta goooo…” Dwight muttered. “Fuckfuckfuck, I need to peeeeeeeee…. I can’t wait, I can’t wait….” Giving a voice to his bladder was helping him calm down a bit, but before long the need to move around was rearing its ugly head again. He began to rock on his heels, very slight and subtle at first, but soon it was rapid, desperate and so frantic Kenneth couldn’t fiddle with the zipper any more.

“H—Hold still…” Kenneth scolded him.

“I’m sorry, Kenneth!” Dwight said, trying to obey. As soon as he ceased rocking, a spurt audibly hissed out and he ground his thighs together to keep anything else from leaking. “I just— I need to go soooo bad! I can’t stay still!”

“Well, TRY to, okay?” Kenneth said. “You’ll be able to pee a lot sooner if you stopped wriggling like this.”

“I’m TRYING!” Dwight protested. He clenched his thighs, tensed his legs, his abdominal muscles went rigid as he tried to fight the tide without moving or grabbing his cock. These attempts were less than successful, dribbles continually rolled down his legs, broken up by loud, hissy leaks as his boxers quickly grew sodden and warm. “Oooooh, hurry! Kenneth, please?”

“I’m TRYING!” Kenneth echoed Dwight’s whine from earlier. “It’s really caught! I can’t get it to move at all!”

That news devastated Dwight, and his bladder cramped even harder. This time, he didn’t just spurt or dribble, he just started PEEING a full-blown stream, and it was gonna get on Kenneth, and— “Ahh!” He gasped, doubling over, clutching himself and crossing his legs tightly.

Kenneth had barely moved his hands out of Dwight’s way as he’d dove to grip his crotch. “I—I can’t help if your hands are in the—“

“I can’t— I can’t hold it!” Dwight cried. “Kenneth, please? I’ve been— I haven’t gone since this morning, I can’t wait anym—“

“I’m fixing your zipper as fast as I—“

“Can’t I just go?” Dwight begged. He looked up from his hunched position, his eyes wide and watering. The pain inside his body was almost making him cry… His bladder didn’t feel like a bladder anymore. It was something else entirely. Like a heavy, leaden orb. Yes, that was it. A heavy, leaden orb, this immense, powerfully crushing weight in his center that was constantly dragging him down, constantly pushing against his sphincters with so much force that they were starting to rip in half. “Please? Please just let me go?”

Kenneth was extremely confused. Did Dwight need a piss so bad that it was making him delirious? He REMEMBERED why he was holding it, right? He still knew his zipper was stuck? “I promise, I’ll get your—“

“N—No,” Dwight shook his head. “I mean… I wanna just… Go. It keeps coming out, and it hurts, and I can’t hold it…” His bladder agreed with him, and another trickle sloshed down his leg. “I wanna go… Just… Not when your hands are over my—“

“Oh…” Kenneth said. He was still fairly perplexed. Dwight WANTED to give up and just have an accident? Wouldn’t that be embarrassing? Wouldn’t that make him feel disgusted, at least a little? A few times, Kenneth had actually tried to deliberately wet his pants to make the pain stop, and his shy bladder had never allowed it.

If Dwight was in pain, and DIDN’T have that same anxiety to deal with, then maybe this WAS the better option? Kenneth couldn’t get that zipper apart with Dwight jumping all over the place, after all. And, he certainly didn’t like knowing that his friend was being hurt… “Are you sure?” he asked.

“Y—Yeah,” Dwight grunted around the bloated ball of tension that seemed to be encompassing his entire lower half. “If I move my hands, I’m gonna pee. And if you’re messing with my zipper, I’ll just piss a—all over you. It’s best if I j—just get it out and then w—worry about everything else.”

Kenneth would definitely prefer to AVOID Dwight peeing on him. “But, you’ll have to… Sit in it until we can get your zipper fixed…”

Dwight hadn’t really been thinking about that part. He’d really only been thinking about the part where he got to GO. The aftermath was certainly going to be awful uncomfortable for him. As he thought about it, he felt his hands growing warm as more urine slid free from his bladder. “I d—don’t have a choice. It’s gonna come out. I wanna get it over with.”

“Okay…” Kenneth said. “Just… Er, sit on the toilet first? Before you… Do it? We won’t have as much to clean up that way.”

Dwight nodded. “Th—Thank you…” he said, shuffling over to the toilet and lowering himself onto the seat. He was still holding his crotch, not quite ready to give in to his body just yet. “Th—This is okay?”

“Yeah,” Kenneth shrugged. “If you’re sure this is what you want to do…”

It wasn’t really what Dwight WANTED to do, it was just that this was the best option he had at the moment. This way, he wouldn’t have to worry about getting Kenneth wet, and the floor would be spared. He let go of himself.

He was shocked, but it took a second for him to start going. It just felt so WEIRD to be sitting on the toilet with his pants still up that his bladder must have gotten confused for a second. But, once it realized Dwight was giving it the signal to release, it well and truly split wide open and he was peeing a heavy, forceful gush into his pants. The liquid jetted into the material, causing it to grow heavy and warm. “Phew… I’m going now, Kenneth…” he said.

Kenneth had spun around to face the opposite direction. “Er, yeah. Thanks for the update, I guess.”

Dwight had released enough now that it was beginning to splash into the bowl, the noise mixing with the hiss of his clothes getting soaked. All things considered, this felt really, really good. Maybe not the warm, sticky feeling coating his crotch and making its way down across his ass, but his poor holding muscles had been straining for so long that finally letting them ease felt almost orgasmic. A small sigh fell from his lips.

Kenneth kept staring at the wall, his back going very stiff. He’d seen and heard Dwight piss lots of times, and had seen him wet his pants on a few occasions as well. What was going on behind him felt completely different though, the guy was peeing himself on purpose, and it sounded like he was enjoying it… All the watery noises of his friend’s pee sloshing out was also making Kenneth sort of need a toilet break himself…

“Mmmm…” Dwight’s eyes drifted shut, and he focused himself entirely on just the sensation of release, trying to blot out the gross feeling of his drenched pants clinging to him. He’d definitely held it too long today, he didn’t know if he’d EVER stop peeing… “Wow, I REALLY had to go…” he mumbled to himself.

“Uh, yeah…” Kenneth said awkwardly. “I— I gathered that…”

The last of Dwight’s pee finally exited his bladder and he at last felt empty. Little streams and drips kept falling from his pants and landing in the bowl, though. His clothes looked like they’d been through a hurricane… “All done, Kenneth.”

Kenneth sucked in a breath and prepared to turn around. How the Hell was HE more embarrassed by all this than Dwight apparently was?! “F—Feeling better?” He asked quickly, forcing a smile as he faced his friend.

“Yeah,” Dwight nodded. “I needed that bad.”

Kenneth gave a small, half-nod. “Alright…” he said. “Glad you’re… more comfortable now.” He knelt down in front of Dwight. “Just—Stay sitting there until I get the zipper apart, in case any more drips come off of you…”

“Okay.”

Kenneth had an easier time fixing Dwight’s zipper issue now. He did cringe at the wet, clammy feeling over his friend’s crotch, but supposed that couldn’t be helped. He didn’t think he’d ever seen or heard Dwight pee that much all at once before, he’d been telling the truth that he couldn’t wait any longer. Kenneth would prefer having to touch Dwight’s pee-soaked clothes over GETTING pee-soaked himself.

At last, he yanked the zipper apart and told Dwight he could stand up. Dwight got off the toilet and started to strip off his wet pants. Truth be told, he didn’t even feel that humiliated by all of this. Only Kenneth had been around to see it, and he’d been looking the other way the whole time. Dwight would just get his stuff washed and no one would ever know that this had happened. It wasn’t a big deal.

Dwight hooked his fingers into the waistband of his utterly drenched boxers and started to lower them.

“O—Oh—!” Kenneth exclaimed, covering his mouth.

Dwight turned around as he let his boxers fall to his ankles. “Hm?”

“N—Nothing…” Kenneth looked away. “W—Wasn’t expecting you to get all naked with me still here, that’s all.”

“You’ve seen me naked before,” Dwight shrugged. “What’s it matter?”

“It doesn’t— I was just surprised,” Kenneth stammered. “And— And I—“ He turned around to face the toilet. “I— Uh… I need to go too now, and—“

“Go ahead, then. Do you need help calming down?”

If Kenneth looked at Dwight again, naked from the waist down, he was gonna need to calm down in an entirely different way! “I d—don’t think so… It’s just us…” He lifted the seat and unzipped. Sure enough, his stream trickled forth quickly and easily. “Ahhh…”

Dwight started to unbutton his shirt as Kenneth relieved himself. He was about to get into the shower when he heard the toilet flush, prompting him to turn back around. “Oh, good job, Kenneth! You were able to go even though you weren’t bursting this time!”

Kenneth blushed and stared at the floor. Being praised for going pee like a little kid, by his best friend who’d just pissed his pants a few minutes ago and was now standing there nude and making him feel all… FUNNY, was making his face flame. “G—Go ahead and… And wash off now…”

Written for the 12 Days of Omo prompt “In Snow”.

Kenneth’s birthday is December 8th, for anyone who wants to know the exact date.

***

Kenneth thought it was a little ironic that he’d been born in December. He was the sort of person that loved warm weather, the tropics, beaches, swimming— Basically anything to do with Summer. And he was the sort of person who hated feeling cold, hated trudging through snow, REALLY hated SHOVELING snow— Pretty much anything to do with Winter.

He really thought he SHOULD have been born in the Summer, because then he’d have ideas of what he’d want to do to celebrate. What could he even DO when stepping outside made it feel like all his limbs were turning into icicles and just taking a few steps through the stupid snow was enough to exhaust him?

He didn’t really celebrate his Birthday that much anyway. He hadn’t for years. The last time he’d done anything for it had been when his Mother was still alive and she’d knitted him a toy flamingo that he’d named Pinky and treasured with all his heart. Until a few months later when his Father threw it into the fireplace. Kenneth had sobbed as he’d watched his dear friend smolder into ash.

After that, he’d just never done anything for his birthday again. When his Mother was still around, she’d ask if he wanted something special, and he’d just say no, because he knew Father would destroy it, so it was better if he just didn’t have things. Once Kenneth had explained why he didn’t want gifts anymore, Mother had gotten a look on her face that he hadn’t been able to understand.

Of course, Father had never done anything to acknowledge Kenneth’s birthday himself. He told Kenneth time and time again that he was not something that deserved to be celebrated.

Growing up, Dwight had always tried to get Kenneth something for his Birthday, and was only successful one year when he managed to dig an old, worn atlas out of a trash can. He knew Kenneth loved maps, so it was the perfect gift. Kenneth had been grateful for it, even tearing up a little, but he’d insisted that Dwight keep the atlas to himself. “I’ll look at it when I visit you, but it isn’t safe if I bring it home.”

Even when they got older and Kenneth had escaped from his Father, he always told Dwight not to bother acknowledging his birthday. “It’s just another day. It isn’t important.” Dwight thought it was important, though. He didn’t understand why Kenneth disagreed.

Bryce didn’t understand it, either. He’d always enjoyed his birthday, the one day of the year no one could begrudge him for wanting to be the center of attention. At the very least, he made sure to give both Kenneth and Dwight the day off, he figured Kenneth would at least enjoy having some extra free time with his friend.

When the day came, Bryce was surprised to learn that HE had it off as well. And, even more surprised when Dwight approached him to request a favor. “Could you take Kenneth into town for a little while?”

“Huh?” Bryce asked. “I gave you time off so that you two could—“

“I want to surprise him with something,” Dwight explained. “I just need a few hours, okay?”

And that was why Bryce was now walking through town with Kenneth. Which wouldn’t be SO bad if Kenneth would talk to him, but he was being oddly quiet.

“Dwight’s just busy today,” Bryce said. “He’s not trying to avoid you, if you’re worried about that.”

Kenneth managed a nod, but couldn’t talk. He knew Dwight wasn’t mad at him— If Dwight was angry, he always told Kenneth why so that they could talk it out. Dwight didn’t hold grudges or give the silent treatment.

But, Kenneth couldn’t speak in order to tell Bryce that because he’d made a REALLY bad mistake.

Kenneth hated cold weather for a reason. The simple fact of the matter was that his body didn’t HANDLE cold that well. Anything below sixty degrees and he was shivering. Below freezing, like it was today, and he could feel the chill all the way down to the marrow in his bones. His teeth were chattering so much that he literally couldn’t talk.

And he hadn’t properly layered up because when Bryce asked to see him, he’d assumed it would only be for a minute and that he could go straight back inside. So, all he had on was his regular uniform, which felt thick and protective during any other time of the year, but NOW felt like it was made of tissue paper!

“Paulson,” Bryce said. “I don’t like when you’re silent. Say something dumb.”

Kenneth rubbed his arms frantically, but the friction did nothing to bring up his body’s temperature. “I— I’m s—so c—cold, Bryce…” His body shook, going numb in places he didn’t even know it was possible to feel numb.

“Ah,” Bryce said. “Is that all? Let me get you something warm…”

A few minutes later, they were seated in the cafe. Kenneth was still shaking from head to toe, shudders raking through him every few seconds. Bryce handed him a mug filled with hot chocolate and encouraged him to drink it.

Kenneth did, the warm liquid heating his insides a little bit, but not enough. He still twitched and rubbed his legs together in an attempt to get some feeling back into them. His fingers felt like they were going to fall off— God, he wished he’d at least put on some gloves! They stung and burned as sensation returned to them.

To speed the process along, he sucked on the fingers of one hand, hoping the warmth inside his mouth would help.

Bryce watched Kenneth as he fidgeted and moved a hand to his mouth. He looked an awful lot like he did when he really needed to relieve himself. Bryce almost asked him if he had to go, but stopped himself. It had been, at most, an hour since they’d left. Nowhere near enough time for Kenneth to fill up. He’d only embarrass the other man if he asked about his bladder now.

Kenneth guzzled from his mug and felt a little better once he’d emptied it. He’d managed to stop shaking, but he still felt so numb. “Bryce, I’m still cold…”

Bryce sighed and stood up, acting as though getting Kenneth a second drink was an inconvenience on par with being forced to shovel snow using nothing but a rusted frying pan. “Alright, you’re lucky it’s your birthday.”

Kenneth finished his second mug just as quickly as he’d done the first. Now that he had something nice and warm in his body, he was ready to walk around some more. The icy wind hit him in the face as soon as he’d stepped outside, and right away he was shivering just as badly as before.

Bryce watched, shaking his head. Of course the idiot was freezing to death, he hadn’t put on a coat! Granted, Bryce hadn’t exactly TOLD him they’d be spending so much time outdoors… “Is there anything you want to—“

“I— Sh—Should find a Chr—Christmas present for Dwight,” Kenneth decided, wrapping his arms around his body and bending forwards, trying desperately to conserve body heat.

The way he was doubling over ALSO made him look an awful lot like he had to urinate. Bryce shook his head, reminded himself that that WASN’T the problem this time. “You’re buying someone else a gift on YOUR birthday.”

“I keep telling you, my birthday’s just a day. And Christmas is just a couple weeks away, so I need to get him something.”

They kept walking, and before long Kenneth was experiencing another of the effects cold weather had upon him; It made him need to… go… a little more frequently than he usually did. And being cold did not make it easy to HOLD his bladder, either. The shudders and twitches he couldn’t stop from soaring through his body shook his bladder up like a soda can, just BEGGING for it to explode. And, since he lost feeling in so much of his body, it was tricky to tighten up his muscles and react to the spasms as quickly as he would like to.

When Kenneth was a kid, he’d shocked Dwight one frigid Winter afternoon. They’d been playing in the woods, Kenneth dying from the cold but putting up with it in order to spend time with his friend. Suddenly, he was hit with an intense need to urinate, so awful that he’d immediately grabbed himself and exclaimed “D—Dwight, I have to—“

Dwight knew right away, of course, and was already helping Kenneth towards a more secluded bush so that he could help him go, but by the time they were there, Kenneth had stopped shivering. His body had suddenly warmed up a LOT because his bladder had burst and dumped its contents all down his legs.

Kenneth was stunned by it as well, shocked not just that he’d had an accident, but that he’d done it outside and where Dwight could see. He’d cried from the embarrassment, and Dwight had tried to cheer him up. “L—Look on the bright side— This means you’re getting more comfortable going in front of me!”

Cold made it so much harder for Kenneth to control his body. Everything inside of him went numb and slack. He hadn’t had a cold-induced accident since the one he’d had as a kid, and it was unlikely he’d have one TODAY when they were walking by so many strangers, but he still knew he needed to get himself emptied as soon as he could. Cold could make him go from ‘I kind of need the bathroom’ to ‘Ahhh, it hurts, I need to pee so bad!’ within a matter of minutes.

Of course, he had to come up with a place where he COULD go before he did anything else. There were two locations in town where he knew he’d have success; The showers at the bathhouse, and that glass sculpture store that had the toilets with super private stalls. He felt pleased with himself for remembering.

And he could probably get Dwight a present at the sculpture store anyway. He told Bryce that was where he wanted to go, and they were on their way without Kenneth having to say one word about needing to pee! Great, he was going to get to handle this without any embarrassment for once!

The walk to the shop was a lot longer than Kenneth’s bladder would have preferred. It was RAPIDLY filling up from the two big mugs of hot chocolate he’d consumed. He kept squeezing his thighs together against the pressure, but it was hard to get his muscles to even respond. He was walking on stiff legs already, his frozen joints refusing to bend very much. He was moving in such a pained, robotic way and he felt like he had very little control over his strides. His steps were all too wide, all shaking his bladder and the pee trapped inside of it.

He kept walking in front of Bryce so he could grab at himself with his chapped hands. His fingers refused to bend correctly, refused to wrap themselves around his length like he wanted them to. All he could do was mash the flat of his palm against himself, and that did little to quell the loose, floaty feeling within his bladder.

Bryce watched as Kenneth shuddered and jerked along the street. His hands kept going around to his front, and Bryce couldn’t help thinking it looked like he was trying to hold his crotch. He HAD had a lot to drink a bit ago, though it was unusual for him to be full enough to grip himself already.

They got to the shop, which was thankfully open. Kenneth entered, feeling instantly warmer now that the wind wasn’t constantly in his face. Bryce followed him, “Which one do you think Dwight would like?”

“Uh— Actually, I need to go run some water over my hands first— If I try and pick anything up right now, I’ll just drop it,” Kenneth said anxiously. He couldn’t stop bouncing on his feet, shuffling between them. Hopefully, it looked like he was just trying to knock some of the snow from his boots.

Kenneth headed for the back, his abdomen going even LOOSER now that his bladder knew it was close to relief. To his shock and dismay, a squirt of pee soaked into his boxers, even though he knew he couldn’t have been THAT desperate already! He was even more appalled at how it had… Honestly felt good. The brief loss of tension was nice, sure, but beyond that… His crotch was getting nice and warmed up now.

He cringed at the direction of his thoughts as he opened the door to the restroom— A difficult task since his fingers STILL wouldn’t bend to work the knob correctly. Another dribble seeped out of him as he scurried for a stall. Fuck, he knew he wasn’t even THAT full! Just, all his muscles were so desensitized. It was like his sphincters had been given a powerful anesthetic, putting them to sleep and making them forget their task.

Finally, he was in the stall. The toilet was THERE, and the lock was easy enough to pull into place without needing to curl his fingers. At last… He reached for his belt and fumbled it apart. Then, he moved onto his buttons, and found he couldn’t actually work them. His fingers just would NOT pinch against the buttons, he could curl them over partway, but then they just stopped responding.

Kenneth jiggled in place, now trying hard NOT to look at the toilet. He waited for his fingers to defrost and get a LITTLE more feeling back into them, but seconds ticked by, his bladder roiled and spasmed until he was crossing he was crossing his legs, and his fingers STILL felt dead to the world.

He knew one way to resurrect them— He could ACTUALLY go run them under the faucet to warm them up. But… Jeez, could his bladder HANDLE that right now?

It certainly couldn’t handle the continued wait…

Kenneth stumbled out of the stall, a confused and pained burst of pee exiting him as he left the toilet without even TRYING to use it. He made it to the sink and used one trembling, stinging hand to crank it on.

The sound of the water blasting out immediately sent Kenneth’s bladder into spasms of stark need. His eyes latched onto the faucet’s gushing stream, he couldn’t look away no matter how hard he tried. Waves of piss sloshed tyrannically against the engorged walls of his bladder.

He just stood there for a second, then with a moan he shoved his hands beneath the faucet. Immediately, he was doing the most elaborate pee dance he’d done all day. Jumping up and down, crossing his legs, squeezing his thighs and swaying his hips. He was flailing with urgent motion, stomping his feet noisily into the floor, he wanted to grab himself so bad… But he forced his hands to remain under the water.

His bladder cramped up hard, contracting painfully and sending another trickling burst into the material of his boxers. “Nnnnh!!” He whimpered, pushing his crotch into the counter. That helped plug him closed again, and he bucked against it, trying his best to blot out the hiss from the sink, the feeling of lukewarm liquid running against his skin. He groaned, leaning forwards and trying to press himself even more firmly against the counter.

His bladder was just… Flaring. Nonstop. Pulse after pulse after pulse of chaotic, rabid need. He felt heat trailing down his length and sucked in a sharp breath. His piss was literally right at the edge of bursting right out… “Hhhhnnnnngggg…. Ahhhnnnn…” Kenneth mewled, bearing down against the counter as hard as he could.

The worst part was that his hands were taking too long to warm up, the water from the faucet wasn’t hot enough!

Wait, no. The worst part was that he now heard the door opening, and that meant someone was going to walk in and SEE him like this— Squirming, moaning, and basically humping the counter all in an effort not to pee down his legs because he couldn’t work his buttons.

“Paulson…?” Bryce asked, pausing between the door and a stall.

Kenneth wasn’t sure if he was relieved that it wasn’t a stranger or not.

“Your fingers are stinging?” Bryce guessed.

They were, but that wasn’t the problem! “Nnnh, Bryce, I need to… I can’t…” He yanked his hands out from under the water. He couldn’t take it anymore. It was torture. And, somehow, what he was about to ask for seemed LESS painful. “My fingers can’t bend, and I can’t get my… My clothes out of the way…”

Bryce stared for a second, then it dawned on him. “Ohhhh, okay. You know, you look the same when you’re cold as you do when you need a piss…”

Kenneth could have lived without hearing that embarrassing little tidbit about himself… “W—Well… I’m having both of those problems now.” He gritted his teeth, unable to believe what he was about to ask for. “Please, can you unzip me?”

Bryce flushed bright red, flashing hot and cold. He finally felt as chilled as Kenneth must have. He was going to… To have his hands touching overtop of Kenneth’s… He might even have to touch on it directly, skin to skin, no fabric in the way… At the least, he was going to SEE it.

He was still rattled from the last time he’d gotten a good look at Kenneth’s penis. How did someone so tiny have such an… Impressive cock? That had to have been where Kenneth’s missing height had gone to. He’d thought that a few times before, but he was sure of it now. And, that dick being on such a small frame made it look even bigger…

Kenneth was probably some kind of proof that being pee shy didn’t have anything to do with ‘size-anxiety’. If Bryce’s was that big, he’d be proud to whip it out and show it off when he had to go.

Bryce had played with dicks before at his secret club. If Kenneth ever went there, he wouldn’t have the biggest one, but he’d fit in well amongst the most endowed men. Bryce had sucked off a few of the men, with Kenneth’s size, he’d be one of the ones he’d nearly choke o—

Dear fuck, why was he thinking about sucking Kenneth’s dick?! He didn’t want to do that! Kenneth would never want him TO do that!

Kenneth was staring at him now, eyes wide and watering. “Bryce, I know it’s weird. If Dwight was here, I’d ask him, but—“

“Okay,” Bryce sighed, rubbing at his cheeks, as if he could somehow erase his blush. “Come on.” He held open a stall for Kenneth, whom followed him in on wobbly legs.

“Hurry,” Kenneth urged, bouncing on his heels.

Bryce nodded, he reached down to begin working apart Kenneth’s buttons. Beneath the fabric of Kenneth’s uniform, Bryce could feel the distinct lump of his bulge. His hands were… Right on top of Kenneth’s dick right now. He could feel a bit of moisture there as well and realized Kenneth must have been leaking. He was about to make a comment on that, if only to chase away his errant thoughts by starting up an argument, but he couldn’t find the words.

Kenneth’s hips twitched and he jiggled a few more times. “Ohhh, hurrryyyyyyy!”

Bryce was surprised that Kenneth hadn’t seemed to realize WHERE exactly he was touching. The other must have REALLY been desperate, because if Kenneth could think clearly he would be clamming up with embarrassment.

The buttons were out of the way and now Bryce quickly lowered Kenneth’s zipper. Kenneth gasped at the sound, wriggling from side to side. “Nnnnhhh…”

“Th—There,” Bryce managed breathlessly.

Kenneth stumbled to the toilet and fished his cock out, aiming as best as he could. He told himself to pee but, of course, Bryce was still THERE… “Turn around…” he muttered.

Bryce was surprised he hadn’t been asked to just leave altogether, he spun to face the wall, and as soon as he’d removed Kenneth from his field of vision, he heard the powerful, roaring gush of Kenneth’s stream flowing into the toilet, and a fluttery moan of relief.

‘Wow,’ Bryce thought. ‘That was FAST.’ He tried to remember if he’d ever heard Kenneth go that quickly in his presence before, this was definitely the first time. He’d barely even turned around all the way, and then Kenneth was spraying!

The strange feelings touching Kenneth’s clothed dick had brought him intensified. Kenneth had made himself piss so easily— Something that he could only do around a person whom he deeply trusted.

Bryce tried not to grow too impatient as Kenneth kept pouring out his bladder. He HAD come into the restroom for a REASON, after all. And being subjected to the sound of SO much running water and pleased, euphoric moans weren’t helpful!

Of course, there were OTHER stalls Bryce could use, but opening the door to this one just for a second in order to get to one would probably give Kenneth a heart attack— No way was he ready to try peeing with the stall door ajar! Bryce just had to wait for him to finish.

Kenneth kept panting, pushing out all of his urine seemed to be warming him up a bit. A lot of the feeling was returning to his body, which was a good thing because he really wanted to feel every drop of his heavy stream exiting him. His bladder was going looser and looser, and finally the last of his burden had trickled forth from his tip.

He was able to put his dick back away and zip up by himself, which immediately reminded him of how exactly this particular emergency had needed to be resolved. He’d practically begged Bryce to undress him… Embarrassment scorched through his cheeks and all the way down his neck; Now that his bladder was no longer screaming and he didn’t even have the pleasure of relief to focus on anymore, the reality of what had just occurred was settling.

He ducked his head and pushed out of the stall. He returned to the sinks and stared at his flushed face in the mirror. He looked like such a mess, all his frantic bouncing had gotten his hair all out of place, and his face was SO red. There was a certain puffiness in his eyes that told him his desperation must have made him tear up without him noticing it.

He waited by the sinks for a moment, unintentionally listening as Bryce relieved himself inside the stall he’d just left. Once Bryce was done, they went back out into the main area of the shop. They found a sculpture of a chili pepper Kenneth was sure Dwight would like since he loved spicy food.

Then they headed back. After half an hour of walking, Kenneth was grabbing his crotch again. He couldn’t help it, the cold was destroying him once more, and his bladder was worn the Hell out from his earlier ordeal.

Bryce noticed and knit his brow. Thirty minutes wasn’t enough time for Kenneth to get full, except for when he had an infection.“Er…” he lowered his voice, even though no one was around to hear. “You want me to take you to see the medics when we get back…?”

Kenneth shook his head. “I’m fine…” he winced. “Just super cold, and I need to… Um—“

“I— I know,” Bryce said. “That’s why I’m worried, because you JUST went.”

Kenneth looked away from Bryce, blushing hard and unable to move his hands from his crotch. “Being too cold makes me need to go a lot. I don’t know why, I just have to get back now.”

Bryce picked up the pace, hoping Dwight had had enough time to prepare whatever he’d been planning to surprise Kenneth with. The more he thought about that, the more he assumed he ought not follow Kenneth all the way to his room this time. He had a feeling that the ‘surprise’ was of a very private nature.

Kenneth made it back to the barrack and Bryce waved him off as he rushed inside, dying to unload a bursting bladder for the second time in the last hour. He got to his room and flung the door open, smashing his palms against his crotch the whole way.

Dwight was sitting on his bed, but sprang up when he saw Kenneth. “Kenneth, I have—“

“Can’t talk,” Kenneth whimpered, kicking off his snow covered boots, then hopping between his socked feet. “Gotta pee…”

“Oh,” Dwight said. “Well, can you wait a minute? I wanted to—“

Kenneth crossed his legs and shuddered. His bladder was fully aware that he was in his safe place right now, so all bets were off. If it wanted to forcibly drain itself, nothing was going to prevent that from happening. But, his fingers probably DID need a little time to defrost before he could manage with his clothes… “Ah— Okay, but ONLY a minute!”

“Okay,” Dwight said, he went back to his bed and retrieved something from beneath his pillow. He hid it behind his back until he was by Kenneth’s side. “I hope you like it… I worked really hard, and—“

“Nnnh, I’m sure I will. Just show me? I’m kind of in a hurry, remember?”

Dwight held the item out for Kenneth to see, and… It was Pinky! Kenneth’s hands lurched away from his crotch and he grabbed the little flamingo. It really WAS Pinky, same face and everything— He’d come back!

Kenneth was surprised when he felt a trickle of liquid. Wetness rolled down his cheeks and he blinked his eyes to try and prevent more tears from flowing. He didn’t cry. He wasn’t supposed to cry…

“I remembered what you said happened to the one your Mom made you when you were little,” Dwight said. “And, I got some stuff in town, and Elizabeth showed me how to put it together, and I… I hope it came out right.”

Kenneth pulled Dwight into a very, very tight hug, squeezing their bodies together, and… Smooshing the absolute FUCK out of his still VERY irritated bladder. He stumbled backwards, “Ah— I forgot, I still have to—!” He spun around and hurried into the restroom.

Dwight smiled, hoping that Kenneth would give him another, longer hug once he’d relieved himself. He was halfway back to his bed when he heard his friend groan, “D—Dwight? My fingers are frozen stiff, c—can you help me with the zipper?”

Written for the 12 Days of Omo prompt "Free Choice". So, here's Kenneth needing some help with his coat.

***

Kenneth was wearing an extremely thick coat overtop of his uniform, thermal undergarments beneath it, and warm woolen gloves on his hands. Yet, he was still shivering with cold. It had taken a lot out of him just to get out of bed that morning, he was so reluctant to leave his blanket and plunge into the frigid air beyond it. By the time he’d managed to get up, pee, and bundle himself into all of the Winter clothing he had, he was nearly late, which Bryce was quick to call out when he saw him.

“S—S—Sorry,” Kenneth said, teeth chattering.

Bryce stared at his shuddering body. “How the Hell are you STILL cold with all that on?”

“I d—d—don’t kn—know,” Kenneth sighed, his breath clouding in the frigid air. “Wh—Why d—do I have to be at m—my post on Christmas, an—anyway?” He’d been hoping to spend the holiday cuddled under his blanket, with Dwight wrapped around him and warming him up— He definitely hadn’t wanted to spend it freezing to death outside.

“Someone has to be,” Bryce said. “It’s not like I’m happy about working today, either.” He watched Kenneth twitch and shiver for a few more seconds, then groaned. “Ugh, you’re useless when you’re like this…” he said, holding out his canteen, which he’d filled with hot coffee. “Drink this, alright?”

Kenneth took it into his own hand warily. He sniffed it, confirming that the liquid it was filled with WAS coffee. He was shocked, since Bryce had gone on-record before that Kenneth should never be allowed within fifteen feet of caffeine, lest it make him act even more obnoxious than usual. Kenneth had never actually HAD anything caffeinated before, and had no idea if it would even make him THAT hyperactive… “Y—You want me t—t—to drink coffee?”

“Yeah,” Bryce shrugged. “Just this one time, if it makes you go all crazy and you start irritating me, then I’m banning you from it forever.”

Kenneth frowned. “O—Okay…” he said. He took a sip from the canteen and swallowed it down, immediately feeling a bit warmer. The coffee tasted good too, which surprised him as he’d expected it to be super bitter— He never would have thought Bryce would put sugar in his coffee. He would have assumed that he’d drink it plain, even if he didn’t like it, just to prove how tough he was. “You like sugar…?” Kenneth asked, testing the waters.

“Ah, no,” Bryce said. “When I grabbed it, I mixed it up with someone else’s. That’s the only reason I gave it to you. Because it’s too sweet.”

Kenneth sighed, sipping again. He should have been able to anticipate the denials— Bryce would never admit that he liked sweet things, and he would DEFINITELY never admit that he’d given Kenneth something hot to drink because he wanted to make him feel better. Kenneth shouldn’t have even bothered asking, he should have known better, Bryce was always going to ‘pretend’ like that, Kenneth wishing that he wouldn’t wasn’t going to change a thing.

Kenneth finished all of the coffee in record time, enjoying the flavor and desperate to heat himself up. He started paying very close attention to how his body felt. He was significantly warmer now that he’d filled himself with hot fluid, but that wasn’t the only change he was searching for. With as often as Bryce said that Kenneth should “never, ever, ever, ever” have any caffeine, because it would turn him into an “unstoppable prank machine that’s incapable of shutting up”, Kenneth half-expected the drink to have given him some sort of super-power.

He knew it was supposed to make him feel more energetic, but that wasn’t happening yet. There were some tingles, though. A skittering sensation going up and down his arms, convening in his chest. It felt super weird.

“Um, Paulson, your arm is shaking…” Bryce said. “Are you still cold?”

Kenneth glanced to his side. His arm was twitching, a LOT. But, just his left one. That was weird, he didn’t normally shiver on just ONE side of his body. “I feel strange,” he said, and he could almost hear his own voice echoing in his ear from far away.

Confusing him further, Bryce started to wave his hand around. It looked bizarre, like he’d sprouted extra fingers. “How many fingers am I holding up?”

“Um… Six?” Kenneth guessed.

Bryce’s brow furrowed. “Wait, have you actually been obeying me and never drinking coffee? Was that your first time?”

Kenneth nodded, the motion making his vision twirl.

“Ah… Fuck, and you just drank a ton of it so fast…” Bryce said. “Well, are you less cold, at least?”

“Y—Yeah, I’m warm now,” Kenneth said. His teeth weren’t chattering anymore, but his mouth seemed to be… Twitching. It was very hard to form words, they seemed to want to come out quicker than he was actually able to say them. “I f—feel fine.”

“You’re jumping around a whole lot…” Bryce said.

Kenneth hadn’t realized he was jiggling. “I’m fine,” he repeated. “I feel g-g-good! Except, I think if I try to stand still, I’ll instantly die.”

Bryce sighed, “Paulson, if you can’t handle caffeine, I will have to continue forbidding you from it. For your health,” he said. “Do try to calm down, and if you really CAN’T, let me know so you can go lay down.”

Kenneth didn’t feel like laying down at ALL. He wanted to run laps, what a pity this wasn’t a day for a fitness exam! He could probably break all of his records! He’d run faster than ever, and he’d even be able to do a whole bunch of push-ups without wearing himself out! Yes, this is what he should do the next time he had to do the fitness test! He’d drink lots and lots of coffee so that he could do more push-ups than ANYONE, even Bryce! Then, he’d run so fast that he’d break the sound barrier, and The Leader would probably award him some kind of medal— Maybe two… He’d get ALL the medals.

Oh, but Bryce wouldn’t let him have any coffee if he kept jumping around like he was now! He had to hold still, behave like energy wasn’t filling him up so thoroughly that it actually kind of hurt. Be still, be still, be still… He managed to restrain himself to just jiggling one leg as his hand tapped against his thigh, but it felt like millions of little ants were running around just beneath his skin and he wanted to hop around and run back and forth, sprinting off to—

Kenneth suddenly found himself able to go still when he realized where exactly he wanted to sprint to. The buzzing energy was no longer the biggest thing on his mind, no longer the most obvious feeling flowing through his body. No, something else was taking center stage now.

His bladder, which he hadn’t even noticed a few seconds ago, now ached with a serious need to be released. Where the Hell had THAT come from? He’d been fine! He hadn’t noticed the need creeping up until he just suddenly had to go super bad! And he’d pissed RIGHT before leaving his room too, which couldn’t have been more than an hour ago! How could he need to pee THIS badly again already? That only happened if he had an infection, and he didn’t THINK he had one. He hadn’t had to endure one of his more ‘extreme’ bouts of desperation recently, why would he have an infection now?!

Whatever the reason, Kenneth had to pee badly, and it was getting worse at such an alarming rate that it sort of scared him. In the mere minutes since he’d first noticed it, his bladder felt like it had already stretched out further. He crossed his legs, reaching a hand to his mouth and accidentally covering his tongue in little bits of fuzz when he bit down on his gloved knuckles. Grimacing, he tore his hand away, shoved it into the pocket of his coat.

He rocked back and forth on his heels. Since his need had taken him completely by surprise, he was having to fight hard to keep up with it. Shifting from foot to foot, he tensed his thighs together and wondered if Bryce would grant him a break this early into the day. His chest tightened, it would sure be embarrassing to say he needed to go so soon after his last toilet break…

Bryce turned to look at him, eyes falling on the rapid shuffling of his feet. “Paulson, if you keep that up, you’re going to slip in the snow,” he said. “THIS is why I’d always been so worried about giving you coffee.”

Oh. Right. That. Kenneth still had to prove to Bryce that he COULD handle the energy boost of a caffeinated beverage. All this jiggling and bouncing that his bladder was forcing him to do wouldn’t help there. In truth, he didn’t even FEEL the hyperactive tickling anymore— He was still dying to move around, but now it was for a completely different reason. “O—Okay,” he said, trying to still himself.

As soon as he’d stopped squirming, his bladder was shrieking. His heavy coat was weighing down upon it, strangling it, adding pounds and pounds of pressure to a load that already felt too big. The waistband of his warm underpants was digging into his bladder as well, and then the belt from his uniform… Everything he had on was making it harder to hold his pee, and not being able to writhe was making it that much worse!

To top it off, when he tried to give his crotch a quick squeeze while Bryce wasn’t looking, the many layers encasing his dick made it impossible to get a decent grip. When his hand pressed between his legs, he didn’t feel ANY relief because he couldn’t make proper contact.

He caught his hand creeping back up to his mouth, and forced that to stop as well. He couldn’t chew his fingers, his gloves were in the way. He couldn’t squirm his legs, Bryce would think he was too hyper. He couldn’t hold himself, his clothes were too thick. All he could do to quell the pangs in his abdomen was tense his thighs up, and that simply wasn’t enough!

Kenneth wanted to tell Bryce that he just needed to go, even if Bryce said he couldn’t leave, at least then he’d be able to move with Bryce knowing the real reason and NOT banning him from coffee for it. But, what if Bryce thought he was lying about needing a piss to excuse the jittery behavior? That was silly, wasn’t it? But, no… Bryce was aware Kenneth USUALLY had an iron bladder that took hours to fill up so thoroughly that he was unable to resist a pee-dance. Kenneth had JUST relieved himself, Bryce wouldn’t believe it if he said that he had to go again now!

Biting his lip and squeezing his thighs together so tightly he felt a bit of a cramp, Kenneth told himself to wait just a little bit longer before he brought it up. Then, after he’d peed, he’d probably ask Bryce if he could go to the medical building, because something was obviously wrong with his bladder since it had filled itself up so much in such a short span of time.

Bryce kept LOOKING at him too, so he struggled to find moments where he could sneak in a foot bounce or a cross of his legs. He was trapped beneath Bryce’s scrutinizing gaze, forcing his body to remain statue still in the face of a thundering pressure that pleaded with him to squirm for all he was worth. His upper body radiated with tension, while his lower half shook uncontrollably. His bladder was cramping painfully, heat searing around the base of his dick and, even in the coldness of Winter, it didn’t feel the least bit pleasant. It felt awful, the precursor to a leak that he was barely able to restrain.

Bryce was paying more attention to Kenneth’s stance than he usually would. He was… Definitely NOT worried about him. The aching pull in his chest was NOT anxiety, it wasn’t anything of the sort! He didn’t care how Kenneth was feeling, or if his body was having a bad reaction to the sudden influx of tons of caffeine after a lifetime without the smallest taste of it. He wasn’t concerned if it was making his head hurt, or his heart beat so rapidly that it was panicking him. He didn’t care. He was only watching for such signs because, if Kenneth didn’t handle caffeine well, he needed to be kept away from it from now on so that it wouldn’t effect his work. That was all. Bryce was ONLY focused on how it affected Kenneth’s performance, nothing else.

Kenneth DID seem to be having trouble, perhaps his body was overly sensitive to caffeine, or maybe he’d had too much for his first try, but he didn’t look like he was doing too well. His eyes kept darting around, and he was sweating profusely in spite of the freezing temperatures. He was obviously trying his best to hold still, but he looked like he was vibrating and every so often he’d give a few quick bounces. He half-wondered if Kenneth was going to need medical attention, for all he knew the guy might be having some kind of allergic reaction.

Bryce watched as Kenneth’s hands fluttered around his body, first moving to his waist and tugging at his coat, then up towards his face before he yanked them back down again. He’d only seen Kenneth look quite this uncomfortable when he badly needed to visit the restroom. But, he was certain Kenneth had done that before he came to his post this morning, so there was no reason to think he’d need to go agai—

Oh.

Bryce had been so worried about Kenneth bouncing off the walls with hyperactivity, that he’d managed to completely forget one of the OTHER effects coffee tended to have on people.

“Paulson, are you alright?”

“F—Fine!” Kenneth insisted. ‘God, please just turn around for a minute?’ He pleaded silently. ‘Just, don’t look at me so I’ll be able to—‘

“Do you know all of the things caffeine can do?” Bryce asked. “Because, it doesn’t only give you extra energy, and you look… VERY uncomfortable right now.”

“I—I’m fine,” Kenneth repeated. His bladder quivered, and finally the heated pressure he’d been feeling at the base of his dick started to move down through it, a squirt of pee hissed into his underclothes and he snapped his legs together, bending forwards. His heart was beating rapidly, face warming as he tried to put a stop to the spill.

“It can also make you need to ‘go’ an awful lot,” Bryce said.

Kenneth struggled back upright, his leak clamped off, but he felt another just on the horizon. He hadn’t heard what Bryce said over the sound of his heart thundering in his ears. What the Hell was wrong with him?! At this rate, he wasn’t going to last another ten minutes! How could he be this close to exploding less than two hours since he’d last peed?! Had he somehow not gotten all of it out earlier?!

“It’s a diuretic,” Bryce said. “Moves straight through you… And you drank the whole canteen REALLY fast, and you’ve never HAD any before, so if you’re needing to… Take care of anything…”

“Bryce, I— I have to— May I please take a break? I think— I don’t know why, but I just NEED—“

“It’s just the coffee,” Bryce reiterated. “Just listen to me, it’s normal to have to go to the bathroom really badly after you’ve drank a lot of that stuff, it runs right through you— Like that tea you tricked Karl into drinking before.”

“O—Oh…” Kenneth exhaled, glad to hear that he probably WASN’T sick, and now that Bryce knew and BELIEVED that he was just desperate to pee, he let himself squirm. He stomped his feet into the snow, digging his heels in before crossing his legs at the ankles. Again, he tried to hold himself, but struggled for purchase through all of his layers. “P—Permission t—to g—“

“Yes,” Bryce said. “Hurry back.”

Kenneth turned and tried to sprint off, tried to RUN at super speed like he’d been so sure the coffee would allow him to do. But, now that it had all filtered through him and stretched out his bladder, the coffee wasn’t letting him move at ALL. He took a few long strides, and then he was leaking so forcefully into his clothes that he had to cross his legs back together and stop short completely to jiggle up and down.

His barrack was SO far…

He didn’t know how he’d ever make it!

He’d barely begun to whimper when Bryce came up to his side. “Is the barrack too long a walk?” He asked quietly.

Kenneth couldn’t bring himself to nod. Nodding would be admitting weakness, admitting weakness to Bryce, admitting to Bryce that he was so desperate to pee after just an hour and a half that he couldn’t handle a twenty minute walk.

“It’s alright, I’ll go get…” Bryce tried to think of where Dwight might be now. He had Christmas off, so he could be anywhere… “I’LL take you to one of the restrooms,” he decided. “And…I’ll try to get you relaxed.”

Kenneth said nothing. He knew there was a restroom nearby, maybe if it was empty…

The walk to the restroom only took a few minutes, but that was long enough for Kenneth’s bladder to force out three more spills. Each one heated up his crotch in a way that felt entirely unpleasant even with the frigid weather. Bryce opened the bathroom door for him and he stumbled in out of the snow. He felt warmer now that he was indoors, but even though the restroom was thankfully empty, it looked intimidating to him.

He heard Bryce behind him, messing with the door. “I locked it,” he informed. “It’s just us in here… Can you try a urinal so there’s more room for us both? The door is LOCKED,” he reiterated, slapping a hand against it.

The urinals looked far more daunting than the stalls— The knowledge that no one could come in here barely helped. But, they ALSO looked like relief, and his bladder was shuddering as he stared at them, urging him to use one. He didn’t understand why his bladder throbbed so furiously at the sight of urinals, when it was ITS fault that he was so seldom able to use one.

“O—Okay,” he said, reaching to his zipp— Fuck, that’s right… He had a LOT of layers to fight through before he could even TRY to pee into a urinal. Frustrated, he started to work the button of his coat, but couldn’t DO it with the gloves on, so he tried to yank one of them off, growling when it wouldn’t come loose.

He jumped from foot to foot, just biting his glove off with his teeth and then ripping off the other one. He held them in his mouth, cringing at the feeling of the material on his tongue. Then, he was fighting with the coat buttons again, and— A dribble of urine was gliding down his leg, tickling his skin, and he hadn’t even felt it coming out, and— “Nnnnhhhh….”

Bryce sighed, feeling nothing more than irritation at Kenneth’s absolutely pathetic behavior— Fighting so furiously with his own clothing, his motor skills obliterated by an urgent need for the toilet— Nothing about that was the least bit sympathetic, and it didn’t make Bryce want to help him out at all. No, it just made him want to deal with Kenneth’s clothes himself so that he could show the idiot how it was done.

He stood beside Kenneth and made quick work of the coat buttons, “There,” he groaned. “Was that so hard?”

Kenneth said nothing, just moved on to dealing with his uniform. He got his zipper down, and then he had to deal with the buttons on his thermal underwear, which proved as tricky as the ones on his coat. It didn’t help that, now that he COULD, he kept instinctively grabbing at his dick every few seconds.

“Do you need MORE help?” Bryce asked, rolling his eyes. “I swear, you are so incompetent…”

Kenneth looked away. “Um… Y—You can, but… it’s…”

Right… Bryce was going to have his hands over Kenneth’s dick AGAIN, just like the day a couple weeks ago at the shop. That certainly didn’t make him feel… ANY way at all. Just annoyed. He was certain that no one else had to come into contact with their subordinate’s cock so often. All of THEM were so lucky, not needing to feel their annoying, stupid subordinate’s bulge as he made all of those… needy… little… whimpering noises and shook so violently beneath the touch.

Bryce HATED it!

Those buttons out of the way, Kenneth finally hobbled to a urinal and aimed himself at it. As expected, his stream stayed locked inside his bladder. Bryce was behind him a second later, though, rubbing his shoulders without needing to be asked, without needing to be told that Kenneth was having trouble getting started on his own.

Kenneth had never noticed it before, but Bryce sure was warm… Leaning back against him, Kenneth felt even more heated than he had just after he’d finished that coffee. It was a little like how he felt when he snuggled Dwight on a cold day, except Dwight’s feet always got icy cold and he thought it was funny to press them into Kenneth’s back sometimes to watch him jump. Now, in Bryce’s arms, he was ALL warm.

Warmth beaded up in his opening, and then a stream was pouring out of him, splattering the porcelain of the urinal. His eyes widened, he was actually managing to use a urinal again! Behind a locked door and with someone there trying to soothe him, sure, but still— He was peeing in a urinal! And, he’d gotten it started pretty fast this time, too!

“Ahhhhh….” Kenneth groaned, loud enough that it echoed and overpowered the (already ear-splitting) hiss of his stream.

Bryce’s face tinted red at the noise. God dammit, when was he EVER going to get used to all those weird sounds Kenneth made when he pissed? When were they going to stop making him feel… Making him… feel… Fuck, Kenneth moaned like he was having the most incredible sex imaginable when he took a leak, it wasn’t Bryce’s fault if THAT sometimes made his mind wander to… Things. Things that… That didn’t really involve Kenneth! Not really! Not—

Kenneth started to shudder, shivers going up his spine as the pleasure of his relief kept intensifying. His body was going so loose, so relaxed, tension faded from every nerve he had. He leaned more against Bryce, legs going wobbly from how good it felt, and he kept shaking with euphoria…

Oh… Oh God… Blood drained from Bryce’s face, from Bryce’s… EVERYTHING, as Kenneth sagged into him and SHUDDERED like that. Kenneth’s twitching and the vocalizations of pleasure that kept flowing from his mouth were having a PROFOUND effect on Bryce, one he was beginning to fear Kenneth would FEEL and REACT to, and—

‘Fuck, fuck, just… Just focus on rubbing his shoulders still, in case he locks up again,’ Bryce ordered himself, and he kneaded Kenneth with more force than was probably necessary, trying to distract himself from the INSANITY currently gripping his mind and body.

Kenneth felt Bryce digging more deeply into the tense muscles in his shoulders, it felt good to be… Basically massaged as he urinated so copiously. He wasn’t sure why Bryce was doing that so intensely, he wasn’t going to complain but… Okay, now Bryce’s hands were moving? And… Over his chest for some reason, rubbing his— “Br—Bryce?” Kenneth asked, his stream faltering but not ceasing. “What are you doing that for?”

Bryce’s eyes, which he hadn’t even realized he’d shut, opened wide. “Huh? Doing wha—“ He stopped, sucked in a breath. He’d let himself act on auto-pilot, and had ended up caressing Kenneth’s nipples through his uniform shirt. “Ah—“ he dragged his hands back up over Kenneth’s shoulders. “I— I don’t know— I’m so sorry, I— Fuck, I shouldn’t have done that, I shouldn’t have— I’m sorry!“

The last of Kenneth’s pee seeped out and he tucked his dick back into his pants, zipping them closed. “Um… Th— Uh, yeah… It’s… It’s always just the shoulders… Sometimes part of my back or neck, but… That’s… It.”

Bryce forced himself to meet Kenneth’s eyes. It seemed the other just thought he’d messed up the calm-down-routine because he wasn’t the one who usually DID it. Bryce was tempted to let him KEEP assuming that, but something in him wouldn’t allow it. Something in him told him that would be wrong. “I… I am so sorry,” he repeated. “I… I just… I behaved very inappropriately just now, I stepped WAY out of line, I… Crossed a boundary, and… I’m very sorry…”

“It’s oka—“

“It’s not,” Bryce said. “I… I don’t know what came over me, I’ve been… Confused as of late, but that doesn’t excuse what I just did. If you’d like the rest of today off, if you’d like a new supervisor, or—“

“Bryce…?” Kenneth asked. “I don’t think I understand.”

Fuck… It was WORSE that Kenneth didn’t even understand what had happened! It was SO much worse! “I… Have been… Experiencing certain ‘thoughts’ lately,” Bryce said. “And, they seem to have gotten out of hand, they are affecting my behavior, and I think it would be in the best interest of… Everyone, if you and Dwight both transferred to—“

“I— I thought we’d been getting along better now!” Kenneth said. “I’m sorry if we made you mad! W—We won’t prank you ever again, or anything! We’ll stop teasing you!”

Bryce’s chest clenched. Everything Kenneth said was making him feel worse. “I just don’t think it’s good for any of us to be… Together in the way we are. Especially not when I am in a position of authority, and I’ve just proven that I can’t control myself.”

“Because you accidentally touched my chest? It felt weird, but it’s—“

“It wasn’t an accident!” Bryce snapped. “That’s the issue! Don’t you get it? I— I just— I TOUCHED you in a DEEPLY inappropriate way, because I’m— I—“

“It’s fine, just don’t do it again next time, and we can—“

“There won’t BE a next time,” Bryce said. “There CAN’T be, I’m not— I shouldn’t— God, you’re so dense!”

“Bryce—“

“I’m attracted to you, alright?” Bryce said. “Do you get it now? Have I spelled it out clearly enough for you? I don’t know why the fuck I am, but I AM. Y—You, and Dwight, and Elizabeth— CHRIST, Paulson, I’ve… I’ve had so many dreams where the four of us are… I CAN’T just keep being involved with you, we’ve gotten too close— I HOLD you while you piss, Paulson! That’s too intimate, it’s too close, this thing we have going on is not appropriate, it’s—“

“You like me?” Kenneth asked.

Of course that was all he’d focus on… “‘Like’ is a strong word…”

“I didn’t realize you liked men at all,” Kenneth said. “You’re always staring at Elizabeth, so I figured—“

“I— I think I kind of just… Like everyone. If someone looks good, then they just DO. And I’ve been with… lots of people, but only in a specific setting that’s SUPPOSED to stay separate from the rest of my life. Those feelings are supposed to just switch off other times, but lately they WON’T, and they keep coming up for… For people I work with and talk to, and—“

“It’s okay if you like me,” Kenneth said. “I’m not going to tell anybody if that’s why you’re worried.”

“I’m not SUPPOSED to think about you that way! You—You drive me crazy! I’m supposed to HATE you, and— And— Whatever I feel about you, it’s nothing like hate, and— God, last week when you hid that stupid rubber snake in my bed again, I SHOULD have wanted to smack you, but I DIDN’T, I just— I thought about how boring my life would be if you weren’t around, and… And that day at the store, when you didn’t make me leave the stall before you pissed, it made me feel… Weird, that you trusted me so much— And I shouldn’t—“

“It’s alright,” Kenneth promised. “I mean, I can tell that you like it when I mess with you, that’s WHY I still do it. At first, I was only doing it to make you mad since you were always being a dick, but then I saw you start laughing at the pranks too, and I thought… You’re always so stiff, you need to be able to laugh… And, I— I do trust you more now, that’s not a BAD thing. You remember that night in the tent when I had that bad dream and you—“

“Yes,” Bryce said. He didn’t want to remember. He didn’t want to remember how soft Kenneth had felt, how good it had made him feel to protect him…

“I think that’s when I started to trust you for real,” Kenneth said. “I don’t want you to put distance between us, I like you too.”

“But… I… I touched you, I shouldn’t have—“

“You shouldn’t have,” Kenneth agreed. “If you can promise not to do it again without asking, then we can try to forget about it.”

“I— I won’t!” Bryce said. “I’m really sorry that I did it at all.”

“Okay,” Kenneth said. “Thank you. Thank you for… Helping me again, and everything.”

“Y—You’re welcome,” Bryce said. “Any time…” He moved to unlock the door so they could leave. “Er… Merry Christmas, I guess. Making you piss is a weird gift, but—“

“I… Uh… I did appreciate it, yeah,” Kenneth said.

I am so sorry for how long it's been. I had trouble with this chapter. I knew how I wanted it to end, and that it would set up the next arc, but for whatever reason I had a difficult time getting there.

***

Kenneth had requested the day off. It wasn’t because he had made any big plans, or because he was too sick to get out of bed. He wasn’t planning to have any fun today whatsoever. Today was not a day that was meant to be enjoyed.

Today was the anniversary of the worst day of Kenneth’s life; The day he lost his Mother. He’d promised himself that he would never do anything on this date apart from taking the time to remember her. He thought maybe her spirit was a little more ‘present’ today than it usually was. Like, maybe she came down from Heaven every year to watch over him and see how he’d grown.

He liked to think that she’d be proud of him.

When Dwight gave him a long, deep kiss before leaving for the day, Kenneth worried that she might not be proud of him at all. What would she think of Dwight? Would she think he was cute and funny? Would she appreciate how much Dwight looked after Kenneth? Would she be happy that he made Kenneth so happy?

Or would she just get stuck on the fact that Dwight happened to be another man?

While Kenneth’s Father had made his views on homosexuality very clear, his Mother had never said anything about it. Of course she hadn’t. It wasn’t a topic people were supposed to discuss. But, that left Kenneth with a lot of questions. He wanted to believe that Mother would love Dwight just as much as he did, and that it wouldn’t matter to her what parts he had. He could never be sure, though.

Every year, Kenneth would pull a small box out from beneath his bed and remove its contents. They were the last things he had from his Mother, the few things Father had never destroyed. First, he took out the small black and white photograph of her. She looked exactly like he remembered her and, in a way, that made him sad. He’d grown and changed so much in the years since her death, but Mother would never get any older.

He spoke in a hushed tone. “Um… Hello, Mother… It’s… It’s been another year.” He felt embarrassed talking to a picture. If anyone heard him, they wouldn’t understand why he needed to do this. “A lot has happened, I guess. Some things have changed. Y—You know my best friend, Dwight? Of course you do, I tell you about him every year. Well, um, THIS year, he’s become… He’s… I— I know you used to talk about wanting to be a grandmother, and how you hoped I would find a nice wife, but…” He sighed. “I wish I could talk to you for real… I WANT to believe you’d be happy, I wish you could tell me…”

Next, he took out her wedding ring. He gazed at it, once more unsure how he was supposed to feel. He’d never understood why his Mother had married his Father. He thought maybe he used to ask her about it, but couldn’t quite remember if he’d ever gotten an answer. The ring made his insides twist in a funny way. It symbolized Mother’s tether to the man whom would eventually end her life, but it was still something she’d worn every day, it was still a part of HER. He couldn’t bear to get rid of it.

After that, there was her apron, her earrings, the songbook she used when she played piano. And then there was the envelope. It was an envelope Kenneth had never opened, though it was addressed to him in Mother’s handwriting. He’d found it in Father’s study the day he’d shot him. He’d never been able to bring himself to open it.

Once he opened it, once he read whatever was inside it, those would be the last words his Mother ever said to him. He didn’t think he was ready for that level of finality. Knowing that there was more, that the letter was still un-read and waiting, made it feel less like she was gone for good.

The final item was the framed photo of himself and Mother, and he was dismayed by the sight of it. The issue was the frame, one side of it had come apart, and the glass was cracked.

That wouldn’t do.

He supposed Mother wouldn’t be disappointed in him for going out shopping today, just so long as it was only for THIS. She’d be pleased that he was trying to keep their photo safe.

He left the barrack right away, wanting to get a new frame as quickly as possible.

Halfway to town, he received an angry scolding from his body, snapping at him that he’d forgotten to do something very important. He had neglected to relieve himself before heading out. He could still turn back around and pee, then leave again… But, he’d already walked all this way, his errand wouldn’t take THAT long, and his bladder wasn’t THAT full.

He could hold it.

If it got bad, he knew two places he could go for a piss.

He’d be fine.

He wasn’t fine.

He managed to get to town while his bladder was still merely tingling, he bought a new frame, left the shop, and thought that MAYBE he was starting to really feel the urge… But, not enough to mess with going to either of his ‘safe’ restrooms. He headed back, returned to his barrack, and by THEN he was pretty eager to use the toilet, swaying very slightly on his feet as he reached for the key to his room.

And that was when he realized he wasn’t fine.

Instead of coming into contact with the cold metal of his key, Kenneth’s fingers went straight through a hole in the bottom of his pocket. A shot of ice rolling down his spine, he frantically checked his other one, hoping against hope that IT was the one he’d stuck the key in.

Nope.

He was locked out until Dwight finished with his tasks for the day.

And his bladder suddenly felt a LOT fuller. Just LOOKING at the door to his room, the easiest place for him to relieve himself, made him desire to go more strongly. Standing beside it seemed to make his body work at lightning speed, increasing the blood-flow to his kidneys, the pump of urine to his bladder, the pulsing at his opening.

He turned away, the sight of the locked door wasn’t helping him at all. He cursed himself for not using the toilet before he’d left. What the Hell could he do now? He could see if any of the other rooms were unlocked and if they had toilets. Not all of the bedrooms had attached restrooms, Kenneth had needed to shine the boots of a LOT of his superiors back when he’d been in training to ensure they’d give HIM one that did.

Some of the guards were careless about locking their doors, one was probably open, and hopefully had a restroom. However, entering someone else’s room without permission was NOT permitted for someone of Kenneth’s rank. If he was caught, he WOULD be disciplined. And, since the reason for his misbehavior was related to his bladder, Kenneth was sure that his punishment would consist of marching drills plus a ‘disciplinary liter’ of water. Unless Bryce was the person put in charge of overseeing his punishment, Kenneth would be put through Hell.

He would not risk sneaking into an empty room.

He could instead KNOCK on someone else’s door. Maybe he wasn’t the only one with the day off, maybe someone was resting in bed. Maybe he could… Ask, out loud, to please, please use their toilet. Then, he’d have to explain why he needed that person to leave their room entirely until he was through urinating. “I—It’s just, I can’t go if you’re able to hear it…”

Kenneth blushed, he didn’t like THAT idea very much, either.

He could use one of the more ‘public’ facilities set aside for the guards. Except, he’d never successfully DONE that by himself before. He knew Dwight and Bryce were both at their posts and, upon checking his watch, he confirmed that their mid-day breaks had passed while he’d still been in town. He couldn’t request any assistance. He was on his own.

But, if he found one that was empty, and then he locked the door, he just might be able to pee. This was probably his best option…

His mind made up, Kenneth left the barrack and headed in the direction of the nearest restroom. Kenneth’s bladder had been teased mercilessly by the sight of the locked door, and wasn’t about to let its owner forget about the displeasure it had been caused. It throbbed harder with every step, his opening stung when he moved his legs too far away from one another.

He pushed open the door to the restroom, praying that it would be empty.

It wasn’t.

Three of the urinals were in-use, and the stall was locked as well. Kenneth’s chest clenched in on itself, and he knew better than to even TRY urinating here. The only stall was already taken, and the mere thought of trying to use a urinal NEXT to someone made his throat go dry and constrict. His bladder constricted along with it, because Kenneth could hear streams gushing out. His own body so badly wanted to join. Aching throbs buzzed sharply in his lower abdomen, prompting him to cross his ankles for a second.

It had been a while since Kenneth had last been in this scenario. Since he so rarely bothered even CHECKING multi-stall public toilets to determine if they’d be usable, he didn’t often have to deal with this; The awkwardness of entering a restroom, finding it too crowded, and then turning right back around and leaving. Certainly, anybody who saw him do that immediately became aware of his problem. They instantly just… Knew that he was broken, and that his bladder didn’t work right.

So, when this happened, he was always forced to improvise; He was going to have to pretend that he’d just come in here to wash off his hands. Yep. That was all. He drank four big glasses of water this morning and hadn’t peed all day, so of course now he URGENTLY needed to wash his hands!

He hated it, but he went to the sink and turned it on. Immediately, the hiss penetrated his ear-drums and made him wriggle his hips. ‘Ohhh, that hurts,’ he thought, miserable. ‘Just do it really fast!’ Everything about being in here was toying with his bladder. The pee-streams splashing, the faucet running, the knowledge that if he was just NORMAL, then HE’D be getting relief now too!

He finally realized he was still holding the picture frame and stuck it into his mouth, trying not to clamp his teeth down around it and damage the material. He ran his hands beneath the water for a couple seconds, then frantically shut the faucet off, and rushed out the door, insides still knotting up with continued tension, pee-hole still burning with the desire to open up and unleash a spray. He wished his bladder would stop searing, it was its OWN fault that it was still full! If it would just LISTEN to him and empty no matter how crowded the restroom was—

He crossed his legs tightly for a second, trying to take in a stabilizing breath. Even THINKING about using that bathroom was making him anxious, AND it was making his need intensify! Dammit, when did his bladder get so freaking suggestible? The sound of water didn’t used to bother him this much! Now, when he heard too much at once, something in him felt like it was coming un-glued, loosening up and trying to fall downwards.

He waited beside the restroom door for a few minutes, trying to make all his shifting look ‘casual’. He’d… He’d just WAIT for it to be empty. There had been four people in there, after they’d all come out, he’d have privacy. He could go then. He was VERY aware of how he must have looked; Fidgeting around next to a bathroom, the CAUSE of his restlessness would be obvious. And, anyone who saw would think ‘Uh, why doesn’t he just go in?’

Three people came out, but two more went in… And this continued. Men would exit, but even more would enter. It got to the point that Kenneth lost track of how many he was waiting on to leave.

He moved a hand to his mouth under the guise of checking his watch. Dwight’s shift still wasn’t over, going back to the barrack would be pointless. The other restrooms would probably be busy, too.

Kenneth HAD successfully ducked behind bushes around here for relief before. If he found one of THOSE that was private enough…

All the ones around here were too scraggly though. They didn’t provide enough cover. He’d feel exposed, and then he’d end up just standing there with his pants unzipped like a moron. He started to pace, looking for something better.

He did not find anything better. In fact, he found something that was a great deal worse; Oliver.

Oliver was another one of the guards. One whom Kenneth just so happened to loathe with the intense, fiery passion of ten billion suns. Kenneth liked to think of Oliver as being the greatest evidence that evolution could actually work in reverse. Oliver was more irritating than thousands of mosquitos and the human equivalent of an uneven table leg. Kenneth found him so annoying that he’d rather hold his bladder for an entire year than spend three minutes talking to him.

What made Oliver annoying was very simple; Oliver was supposed to be one of their informants. He was supposed to notify them about important things, such as trespassers, or dwindling supplies. Oliver DID inform others of these things, but he had a very lax definition of ‘important’. He liked to alert people to just about everything— No matter how obvious it was. He’d state that the sky was blue as if this was newly discovered information that could not go unnoticed.

The worst thing about him was that Kenneth really couldn’t tell if he was being serious or if he was deliberately messing with everyone. Oliver spoke with a blunt tone, and his expressions were always blank. No matter how another person talked TO him, he never reacted in any meaningful way. He was constantly stoic, making it impossible to work out if he actually believed he was supposed to inform people of every, little thing, or if he just thought it was funny to irritate everybody.

So, when Oliver stopped Kenneth and decided to notify him that “You need to relieve yourself very badly”, Kenneth didn’t know how angry he should be. Because, if Oliver really WAS constantly stating the obvious to goad people into reacting, then this current situation was a lot more embarrassing than Oliver genuinely thinking that Kenneth was somehow UNAWARE of the fact that he really had to pee.

If it was the first thing, then Oliver was deliberately making fun of him for his desperation. If it was the second, then Oliver was just an idiot.

Either way, Kenneth didn’t particularly like being around him right now. “I know that, Oliver…” he muttered. “You don’t need to tell me.”

“You shouldn’t hold it,” Oliver said. “You might wet yourself, and that would be embarrassing.”

Kenneth’s jaw clenched against the urge to shout. He was aware of THAT as well— Although he knew that his odds of actually wetting himself in public were basically nonexistent. Far more likely he’d just hurt himself again. Oliver did NOT need to know about that, however. Kenneth was thankful that, so far, the only other guards who knew of his bladder issue were Dwight and Bryce. If Oliver found out, he’d decide to ‘inform’ everyone in the country about it.

“You need to urinate very urgently,” Oliver added. “I will show you where the restrooms are.”

“I’ve been here longer than you…” Kenneth mumbled, thinking he should have savored those months before Oliver’s arrival a little more.

“I have to go as well, I’ll come with you,” Oliver said.

Kenneth had no intention of finding out what trying to take a piss near Oliver would be like. Torture, most likely. “I can wait,” Kenneth said. “I was just about to head back to the barrack, I’ll be fine until then.” His bladder gave a brief, panicked throb, reminding him that he wasn’t fine, and that the barrack held no promise of relief.

“That’s a long walk,” Oliver stated. “Look, there’s a restroom right over here…” He led Kenneth a little further, and they came to a different bathroom. This one was more unusable to Kenneth than the first one had been! There was a HUGE line, indicating that several of the guards must have just been granted breaks.

Kenneth would not get out one drop here. There was no point in even trying. He’d only make himself feel more desperate and frustrated. He turned on his heel, and was jerked back when Oliver took his wrist. “Part of my job is to keep the rest of you out of danger,” he reminded. “You will hurt your bladder if you don’t go soon. You’re squirming so much.”

Kenneth… actually HADN’T noticed that he’d begun to fidget. But, when he looked down he confirmed that he indeed was. His knees were close together, and his thighs clenching as he rocked slightly from side to side. His bladder felt extremely heavy, and the urge to let it relax was strong.

He just knew that he couldn’t DO that here!

“I’m fine, Oliver,” Kenneth insisted. “Just—“

“We should get in line before it gets any longer,” Oliver said. “You can go first, since you’re dancing around.”

Kenneth was NOT ‘dancing around’, he was just a little wriggly, that was all… So long as he kept his legs pressed against one another, he could handle the internal pressure. What he COULDN’T handle was the external pressure. Right now, when he WASN’T in line for the toilet, it was possible that people who saw him could write off his tension and anxious bouncing as something else. If Oliver forced him to get in line, and he couldn’t make himself stop moving around, then it would be OBVIOUS that he really had to go.

Then when he got to the front and couldn’t get his stream started, the room would be crowded enough for at least one person to notice THAT, too.

The line was off-limits. It would reward him with no relief, just an enormous amount of embarrassment.

Oliver wouldn’t allow him to leave, though. So, he was STUCK in the line, trying to think of what he should do. He didn’t even allow himself to hope that he might actually PEE here, he knew he had a better chance of winning the lottery on the same day he got struck by lightning twice. But, to avoid catastrophic humiliation, he was going to have to PRETEND to go, and to make it convincing.

He’d have to lock himself into a stall, unzip, and stay in there JUST long enough for an urgent pee to take place. He couldn’t remain there for too long, or it would be obvious that he was struggling. He couldn’t leave too soon or no one would think he’d actually peed. He’d have to hope that there would be enough watery noises in the room to cover up the fact that he wasn’t producing one. Then, he’d have to flush the toilet— A sound that always made his bladder cramp— to make it more convincing. After that, he’d be forced to leave the stall and wash his hands, all without squirming around and making it clear that his bladder hadn’t actually been emptied.

And, all of that was going to waste time he could have been spending on finding somewhere that he actually COULD relieve himself.

First thing’s first, he had to endure the line. It was partially out the door, and in the time since he and Oliver had joined it, a few more men had gotten in behind them. Kenneth was wary of them, they had a clear view of him, they could see that he was bouncing up and down. He tried to stop, but he just couldn’t. If he went still for longer than a second, his bladder started to shudder and squeeze in on itself, walls spasming with the need to push out his liquids.

He was being so obvious about it… Squirming and bobbing up and down as he waited for a toilet that he KNEW he wouldn’t be able to use.

The line was moving quickly, at least. So, hopefully he wouldn’t waste TOO much time here. He’d endure this Hell of awkwardness, put up with his bladder stretching out even further, and then go find a spot where his body would actually be willing to cooperate. Somewhere that wasn’t crowded, somewhere that people wouldn’t be waiting on him to finish, somewhere that—

“You’re dancing a LOT,” Oliver said. “You’re about ready to go right here!”

Somewhere… Somewhere without Oliver!

“I— I wouldn’t do that!” Kenneth cried, horrified at the suggestion. His midsection felt bloated, and he attempted to use the picture frame as some kind of ‘shield’ to hide the hand that had gone to his crotch. Honestly, he WISHED he could go right here. If his bladder didn’t freeze up and refuse to empty out, he needed relief so badly that he’d just unzip and let go into the dirt between his feet. Screw the line. He was done waiting.

But, his body just didn’t WORK that way, and no amount of desperation would change that. “B—Be quiet, Oliver!”

“You’re holding yourself,” Oliver said. “You’re close to bursting. You should ask if you can cut ahead.”

Well. That would get all of this over with faster… But, it would be humiliating. He was crossing his legs now, jiggling in place, gripping his dick as he tried pathetically to hide that fact with a picture frame. Begging to skip the line would make it even worse.

The line kept moving, and eventually Kenneth could actually get through the door of the restroom, his ears immediately being assaulted by an onslaught of water. Streams gushing into toilets, hissing into urinals, sink faucets running. Occasionally, one of the men peeing would let out a sigh, making Kenneth bounce faster and blush harder. It was like they were showing off. ‘Oh, look at me, I can piss wherever I want! I don’t have to hold it in all day, every day!’

It annoyed him to no end. Didn’t they realize that SOME people didn’t have that luxury, and that being forced to stand there and listen to them vocalize how good it felt to piss was torturous? Kenneth was so irritated, his bladder scorching and flaring within him. He needed to get OUT of here, he couldn’t stand the sounds, every drop of fluid being ejected in that room was adding to his burden, and if he didn’t find some freaking silence and privacy—

“The sounds here are driving you crazy,” Oliver said. “I can tell. Only a few more minutes. Try not to listen, that will make it worse.”

Kenneth felt one of his eyelids spasm. ‘Yes, Oliver,’ he thought. ‘I’m AWARE of that. I KNOW that if I listen to people piss, I’ll need to piss even worse! Thank you for that astute observation! Please never speak to me again!’

Finally, he was next in line. Not that it really mattered. He’d be leaving this room as full as he’d entered it. Maybe— Maybe he should go to the medical building after this. Elizabeth knew of his… ‘condition’, if he explained he was locked out of his room, she’d let him use the private restroom there. Or maybe he should—

He felt Oliver nudging him and looked up to see that—

All of the stalls were still locked, but one urinal was available. If he were NORMAL, then he’d scramble in front of it and release his pent-up stream. Since he wasn’t normal, his heart just started to pound loudly in his ears. The urinals didn’t have dividers, it was going to be WAY harder to fake a pee there than it would be in a stall…

Oliver poked him once more, and Kenneth forced himself over to the urinal, if only to get AWAY from him. His insides churned once he was in front of it. One of the most frustrating aspects of his problem was that his bladder still reacted to the sight of the urinal, lurching and spasming and pushing hard against his strained holding muscles, as if it really WAS about to empty.

Then, of course, when he unzipped and aimed at the thing, everything immediately came to a screeching stop. His bladder just kept throbbing, twisting up on itself, refusing to give out for even a second— Ohhh, just one second of relief would be amazing. But, it was utterly unobtainable for him. He was actually SHAKING from how nervous he felt.

With the bathroom being so crowded, and with everyone in it bursting to go, nobody bothered with leaving ‘gaps’ between the urinals. Every one of them was taken and in use, so Kenneth was shoulder to shoulder with two people as he tried to go, all too aware of the noise their streams were making. For a moment, he tried to shut his eyes and just FOCUS on the sound, thinking that it might coax his OWN bladder into releasing. It didn’t work, of course. The hissing was less a prompt to start peeing, and more a reminder of his complete lack of privacy.

The two beside him both left and Kenneth knew he’d been standing there for way too long now. But, for some reason, he couldn’t make himself LEAVE. He couldn’t handle the finality of tucking himself back into his pants and zipping them up. He needed to go so freaking badly, he was AT a toilet, he should have been peeing! He WANTED to pee, he wanted to unclench and let it all come flowing out, in the middle of this crowded room. He wanted to piss so loudly and furiously that it drowned out everyone else. He wanted to… He just wanted to go! This was so unfair!

Oliver took one of the urinals beside him and he felt the back of his neck prickle. He had a sneaking suspicion that Oliver NEVER shut the fuck up when he was peeing next to someone else.

Sure enough… “You’ve been here a while.”

‘I KNOW that!’ Kenneth seethed. ‘I’ve been trying to—‘

“You aren’t peeing.”

Kenneth panicked and tried to cover his dick. “Are you looking?!”

“No,” Oliver said. “But, I have ears… Normally people start urinating after a second or two— Especially if they’re desperate like you are. But, some people are pee-shy, which is the inability to urinate in the presence of—“

“That’s it!” Kenneth snapped, furiously tucking his cock back into his pants and zipping them. Oliver was… He was fucking with him. He HAD to be fucking with him. No one could be that oblivious unless they were TRYING. Kenneth stormed out of the restroom, not bothering with the sinks. He couldn’t handle having water touch his hands now, and needed to be as far away from Oliver as possible.

In his anger, he’d started to take harsh, stomping steps that shook the contents of his bloated bladder. It hurt, but he was reaching that level of rage where everything else tended to fall away for him, and the only thing that mattered was finding someone to scream at and something to break.

Since Oliver was not here to shout at, Kenneth just angrily muttered to himself as he went back to the barrack. “Stupid… Annoying… Who the Hell DOES shit like that?! I’m gonna… I’m gonna staple his god damned urethra shut, see how he likes it— I’ll—“ He was trembling, it was getting hard to see straight, his breaths were getting more and more shallow with each passing second.

One hand was gripping his crotch, the other held onto the picture frame. The frame for the photo of his Mother…

When Kenneth was really little, when Mother had still been alive, he didn’t get angry like this. He didn’t get so mad that he felt like his chest was going to blow up, and like he’d die if he didn’t scream himself hoarse. He’d get a LITTLE frustrated sometimes, and Mother would just hold his hand and tell him to focus on his breathing.

He squeezed the picture frame in his hand almost as tightly as he was holding his aching member, and he tried to breathe. Slowly, the heat and rage dwindled, and he could see clearly again. He could see that he’d made it back to the barrack.

He’d just wait by the door to his room. He’d wait for Dwight to come back. Kenneth was done with people for the day. If the next one to speak to him WASN’T the one he was in love with, he was liable to yell at them until they went deaf.

He gingerly sat next to the door, setting the frame down beside himself, finally freeing up his other hand so it could give his dick a nice, firm grip. He was alone here. He could writhe as much as he wanted here. So, he did. He curled over on himself and squeezed his member as hard as he could. Sweat rolled down his back, and he did his best not to think about how close he was to his restroom. It was just on the other side of the door! If he just had something he could pick the lock with…

But, a picture frame was incapable of such a task, and no part of his uniform could be used for it, either.

He just had to wait, he had to deal with the rippling pangs of urgency that worsened every time he inhaled.

Kenneth didn’t have to wait TOO much longer, thankfully. Dwight had finished his work for the day. Kenneth didn’t notice him approaching until his hand was suddenly on his shoulder. “Kenneth, what are you doing out here? What’s the matter?”

“M—My pocket had a hole in it, I lost my key and locked myself out,” Kenneth said. “And I haven’t… I haven’t peed all day!”

Dwight noticed where Kenneth’s hands were… “Oh, poor thing…” he said gently. He stood to unlock the door, his chest aching with sympathy. He knew what day this was, he knew what it meant to Kenneth, that he’d ALREADY been in a fragile emotional state BEFORE he’d gotten desperate with no means of release. He hoped nothing too upsetting had happened to him as a result…

Dwight opened the door and stepped aside so Kenneth could go in first, he tried not to pay attention to how wobbly Kenneth’s legs were as he walked. He was really bursting…

Kenneth swayed from foot to foot as he unzipped in front of the toilet, and started to pee before he’d aimed properly, a strong tidal wave of a stream slamming into the water within the toilet bowl, creating an echoing hiss. He blushed as he corrected himself so it would make less noise. There was little he could do about what poured from his mouth, though; A guttural moan that made it VERY clear how badly he’d needed to do this. “Ahhhh….”

Outside, Dwight blushed at the noise. It had been a while since the two of them had explored one another, and that euphoric, panting groan sounded enough like the exclamations of pleasure Kenneth made in bed to get Dwight a little excited.

He turned to Kenneth’s bed, seeing the items still laid out on it. This was not the right day to resume their experimentations. Dwight’s eyes stilled on the sealed envelope. Why hadn’t Kenneth ever opened that?

Kenneth returned a couple minutes later, pink in the face and looking utterly relieved.

“Better?” Dwight asked.

Kenneth nodded, then looked away.

“Something bothering you still?”

Kenneth explained the incident with Oliver to him, and how furious he’d gotten. “I swear, he WAS trying to mess with me this time!”

“It’s so hard to tell with him,” Dwight said. “But, it’s okay you got mad about it.”

“I wish I didn’t…” Kenneth said. “When I get mad it… Sometimes it literally HURTS, physically. Is that normal?”

Dwight paused. He’d never gotten so angry that it caused him pain before. “I don’t know,” he said.

“Today was supposed to be about… You know, my Mother,” Kenneth said. “Not about how pissed Oliver could make me feel.”

“It’s alright,” Dwight said. “I’m sure she doesn’t want you to spend all your time grieving…”

Kenneth sighed. “It feels wrong if I don’t,” he said. “I… I miss her so much.”

Dwight sat down on the bed and gestured for Kenneth to join him. He pulled him into a hug. “I know you do… You shouldn’t have lost her so young, especially not… Not in the WAY you did.”

“I wish she was still here,” Kenneth said. “She’d be able to calm me down when I get mad… She’d probably even be able to fix my stupid piss-thing.”

Dwight wasn’t so sure about that. He figured Kenneth’s Mother would TRY to fix it, but would she succeed in getting rid of it for good?

“What’s in the envelope?” Dwight asked, trying to change the subject.

“It’s… It’s her last letter to me,” Kenneth said.

“You’ve never read it?”

Kenneth shook his head. “Once I read it… That’s… ‘It’. You know?”

Dwight could understand that, but… “She must have really WANTED you to read whatever’s in there. She wouldn’t have left it for you otherwise.”

“I— I know, but… What if it’s something bad?”

“What could be bad in it?”

She could have written about what she wanted for Kenneth’s future; A wife, a family with children… She could be disappointed in what had actually happened.

Kenneth shrugged.

“I bet it’s something good,” Dwight said. “Your Mother loved you. I think you should read what she had to say.”

Kenneth picked up the envelope. He hesitated, hands shaking, then he forced himself to peel it open. He started to read it quietly, but then his breath started to hitch, his eyes watering.

‘To my darling Kenny,

I’m writing this now because I fear there may come a day when I will no longer be beside you. Truth be told, Kenny, I’ve been reflecting on a lot of things. A lot of regrets, mostly. Throughout my life, I’ve never been much more than a doormat. I’ve always been too focused on what my own Mother wanted me to be than on who I wanted me to be.

I’ve not yet told you about several things that happened to me, but when I was a child, I was hurt very badly by several men. My Mother knew, and was happy to accept money from these men in exchange for time with me. You will understand when you are older. I felt it was my duty to allow these things to be done to me. Those feelings are ones I never managed to run away from.

I don’t know if you remember, but you used to ask me why I married your Father. Over and over again. Back then, I was pretty shaken up by this, but I never once thought you were wrong to ask.

Years ago, my Mother and I had just moved to town. I played piano every night in a small bar to help make ends meet. This is where I encountered your Father for the first time. From the start, I did not feel comfortable in his company, but the word ‘no’ had long-since been removed from my vocabulary, ‘yes’ had been saturated into me. I never told him ‘go away’, I never told him ‘I want to be left alone’. Obediently, I played the part that had been written for me from as far back as I can remember.

At the same time, I’d begun to attend the local church— The one I’ve brought you to a few times. It was there that I met Ann; you and she met once when you were very small, but I’m unsure if you’d remember her now. For a time, Ann was my everything. I know it’s not proper for a woman to view another woman in these terms, but her beauty captivated me. She had the most delightful singing voice. When she spoke to me, her words filled me with elation and hope. Every moment I was beside her, I was able to feel happy, I was able to feel that I may someday become the sort of person that could stand up for herself and be heard.

But then, there was my Mother. I spent my entire life trying to please her, everything I did was done at her beck and call. When the moment came where I did truly need to stand up for myself, when I was made to choose between Mother and Ann, I faltered. I made the wrong choice. I failed myself, but worse, I failed Ann.

After that night, the worst night of my life, my Mother reminded me of your Father. “He’s a nice man. Why don’t you spend more time with him?” And, like the well-trained dog I’d become, I obeyed her. I spoke to your Father more and more, ignoring the ill feelings he gave me. It wasn’t long before he managed to coax me into laying with him. He did so by telling me a lie; He told me I was smart, and only Ann had ever said that before. I thought, perhaps, I could pretend he was Ann. I thought, perhaps, that he could cure me of my feelings for her.

He didn’t. He instead had left me with child. Becoming pregnant out of wedlock was the final straw for my Mother, and your Father’s Father hauled him out in front of everyone in town and beat him in broad daylight until he agreed to do the proper thing and make me into his wife. Those nine months were some of the hardest of my life. Every second of every day, I lied to myself. I told myself that it would be okay, that I could learn to love your Father. I tried to ignore his constant drinking, his aggression. When he hit me, I thought only of what I must have done to provoke it— I am sure you know this feeling, please don’t listen to it. Your Father’s mistreatment of you isn’t your fault.

But, I also was thinking of you, of how I couldn’t wait to meet you. When you were born, I learned how to smile again. You are the best thing that has ever happened to me. When your Father allowed you and I to go outside, everyone loved you. Everyone wanted to take you home. You were always polite, always with manners. Oh, I remember whenever you couldn’t sleep, you’d crawl up into my lap and beg me to play piano for you. Whenever I was hurt, I could always count on you to hug me.

I am overwhelmed with the wish that I had been able to do more for you. I have done everything in my power to protect you from you Father. I have been up half of tonight trying to think of some way out of this madhouse, and I have nothing. Without your Father, we will be without money or shelter. The bar sent me away as soon as my pregnancy became noticeable, they won’t welcome me back now, and your Father would always be there nevertheless. My Mother is so overwhelmed by the shame I brought to her, she would not be willing to help.

The only person I may be able to rely on is Ann. I haven’t had a true conversation with her since you were two. It has been five years. I can’t ask such a tremendous favor of the girl whose heart I broke.

I have accepted that someday, your Father may cause something to happen to me. I don’t think I’m that afraid for myself, but I am for you. You are the most precious thing in my world and, if I ever leave you, I will continue to watch over you from wherever I end up.

Do you remember when you were learning to tie your shoes? It took you a while. But, you never gave up. I’d find you in a corner of the room trying to tie knots. That’s one thing about you, Kenny, you never give up. I hope you never, ever lose that spirit I see in you. Don’t be like me. Don’t allow your Father to dictate your life. Don’t let him win.

I love you. I’ll always love you. And I hope you find happiness in your life. You deserve only the best.

Meeting you has been the greatest gift of my life, and I’m so grateful to have had this opportunity. I never got to be the person I wanted to be, but I wouldn’t give you up for anything.

However, I do have one final, selfish request. If you ever have the chance, please tell Ann that I never stopped loving her.’

Kenneth didn’t think he’d ever cried harder at anything in his life.

*123*2023-04-09 20:58

The first thing Kenneth did the next day was go to Bryce with Dwight and request more time off. He explained the letter to him. “I think I do remember Ann,” he said. “She was in the choir. She may still live in the same town, and it’s a really small place, so I can probably—“

“Paulson,” Bryce interrupted. “I don’t want you to get your hopes up too much. That letter only listed this woman’s first name, and the name ‘Ann’ is extremely common. I’ll bet there are several women with that name living in your hometown.”

“That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t at least try to find her,” Kenneth insisted. He didn’t care what Bryce said, he was going to look. And he was GOING to find Ann. His Mother had said he ‘never gave up’, he didn’t want to prove her wrong now. Certainly not about her dying wish.

Bryce sighed. He could tell this was deeply important to Kenneth, and he understood it. He really did. He just didn’t think traveling to the other end of the country in the hopes of locating a woman who may not even be there anymore was such a great idea.

“Kenneth…” Dwight said. “I know this means a lot, but the one time you saw her you were, what— Two?”

“Yeah.”

“So, that’s over twenty years ago,” Dwight said. “She could be anywhere by now. Like you said, it’s a small town. If you ONLY ever saw her once—“

“That’s just the only time I REMEMBER seeing her,” Kenneth remarked. “I could have seen her fifty other times after that, but I just didn’t realize because I didn’t know that she was important!”

Dwight understood Kenneth’s determination as well. He too just didn’t think the odds were in favor of finding Ann. He also didn’t believe Kenneth had quite thought all of this out yet.

After Kenneth had killed his Father and staged a false suicide, he and Dwight had fled from their town as fast as they could. They had never, EVER gone back. That place was filled to the gills with memories. Some of them were good, like the day they met, the games they’d played together… But the vast majority were just awful. Dwight’s skin was itching a little at the thought of going back— And the worst things HE’D suffered as a kid were loneliness, hunger and a bit of bullying.

Kenneth had been utterly tortured in that place.

He didn’t seem to be thinking over how it would feel to go BACK there at all.

“Besides, maybe the church kept records of everyone that was ever in the choir.”

“I guess that’s possible, if unlikely,” Bryce said. “But, we have work to do HERE. At the very least, it will take us several days to GET there and locate this person, and we may not find her at all.”

“Y—Yeah,” Dwight said. “Maybe we can try this someday, but not right n—“

“You two don’t have to come with me,” Kenneth said abruptly, turning and walking away.

Dwight was rooted to his spot. He was certain about only one thing; Kenneth could NOT return to his childhood home alone. Just the idea of Kenneth seeing all those places again with no one there to hold him…

“Hey, wait,” Dwight rushed after him. “I’ll go with you.” He took Kenneth’s hand. “Bryce can probably pull some strings and get us time off, and I know this means a lot to you. I was just—“

“Besides,” Bryce said, startling Dwight whom hadn’t noticed him following. “The second you need to piss during your trip, and you realize Dwight and I aren’t there to help you, you’re gonna freak out.”

“I— I would not!” Kenneth scoffed, knowing that he definitely WOULD. The journey to his hometown would be extremely long. Even if he didn’t drink even one drop of water during it, he’d be beyond full by the time it was over, and would be incapable of emptying. He was instantly hit with the mental image of himself hobbling into town with his hands between his legs and trying to remember where he may be able to find decent privacy. The search for Ann would transform into a search for relief REALLY fast and he’d probably get so overwhelmed by the pressure that he’d forget the ACTUAL reason he’d gone there!

“We’ll go with you,” Dwight said. “It’s just… I don’t want you to get your hopes up too high. We might not find her.”

Kenneth nodded, but inside he thought ‘I WILL find her, whatever it takes.’

***

A few days later, the three of them were waiting at the train station. “We’re going to have to walk for a while too,” Dwight warned Bryce. “The town Kenneth and I grew up in doesn’t have its own station, the closest one isn’t TOO far though.”

Bryce shrugged, “Walking’s fine,” he said. “But, there really isn’t a station there? How small is this place?”

“Tiny,” Dwight said. “I mean, there are probably only a couple hundred people living there. You can’t even really call it a town, more like a village. A train station isn’t the only thing it’s missing.”

Bryce had grown up in one of the country’s largest towns, it had multiple train stations just to get from one part of it to another. Over a million people had lived there, at least. Growing up, Bryce was always among strangers when he went out, encountering new people and exploring places he’d never been before— Despite living there his whole life.

Kenneth and Dwight probably knew every bit of their hometown forwards and backwards. And, Bryce doubted many of the people there had been strangers to them for long. Everybody would have known everybody.

Something about that was tugging at the back of Bryce’s mind. He wasn’t sure what, just that it was making him uncomfortable.

“What else is it missing?” Bryce asked, trying to will the unsettling sensation away.

“You know how you went to school in a specific building with a bunch of other kids?” Kenneth asked. “Our village didn’t have a place like that. You either sent your kids to a neighboring town, which was expensive, or you taught them at home. Most kids were taught at home. Like I said, the schools were far away and it cost money to go to them if you didn’t live close enough. Lots of people couldn’t afford that.”

“The nuns at the orphanage taught me and the other boys I lived with,” Dwight said. “So, it was kind of like going to school, I just didn’t have to walk anywhere new.”

“My mother was my teacher,” Kenneth said. “But after… Well, Father didn’t bother continuing with it.”

The uncomfortable feeling grew as Bryce recalled all the times he’d told Kenneth that he was an idiot. Kenneth had ceased receiving any form of education after his Mother died, when he’d only been seven. That meant anything Kenneth DID know, he’d had to learn it by himself. He’d had to teach himself how to read and write without any guidance, and with someone torturing him the whole time.

Kenneth could even speak a foreign language— It was one Bryce didn’t understand, but when they’d visited neighboring countries, Kenneth had been the only one that was able to read signs, ask for directions, hold conversations with people. Kenneth had somehow managed to become fluent in a new language without anyone else’s instruction.

An idiot wouldn’t be able to do that.

“How’d you learn how to speak a new language?” Bryce asked. “You’re able to do it so well, you must have started young.”

“I did,” Kenneth said. “When I was little, I always thought that one day I’d be able to grow up and leave Father, and I’d go live on the beach where everything’s bright and warm and calm. So, I couldn’t let him… I… I had to make sure I DID grow up, because otherwise I’d never go. But, this country doesn’t have a coast so I’d have to go somewhere else. And I thought ‘I probably won’t be able to FIND the beach if I can’t talk to anyone,’ so I got a translation dictionary from the library— We did have one of those, it was just really small— and a lot of the time, once Father was asleep, I’d just read a page over and over again until I’d memorized it, then I’d hide the book so Father wouldn’t take it.”

Bryce couldn’t imagine reading the same page of a book multiple times— Especially not something as boring as a dictionary. He really couldn’t imagine doing that when a person who’d repeatedly left him at death’s door was asleep in the other room. He wouldn’t be able to concentrate.

Kenneth did ALL that just so he could see the beach?

“You’ve still never GONE to a beach, have you?” Bryce asked.

Kenneth shook his head. “I’m sure it will happen one day,” he said.

Bryce hoped so. The unpleasant feeling in his head was still there. What Kenneth wanted, what he’d spent his life dreaming about, was something so simple. ‘I had to make sure I did grow up’. Had this wish been one of the things that kept him alive, kept him from succumbing to his own despair, kept his body pressing forwards in the face of extreme dehydration and severe injuries?

Kenneth deserved to go to the beach…

Bryce wished THAT was where they were headed now. Not to the tiny village where Kenneth had nearly died several times.

‘Only a couple hundred people…’

That kept nagging at Bryce, and he still couldn’t figure out why.

He cleared his throat, trying to dislodge the lump that had suddenly formed there. He didn’t know why THAT had appeared, either. The sensation had no business being there. “S—So, how long are we gonna be on the train for?”

“At least twelve hours,” Dwight replied. “Possibly longer. There will be stops, of c—“

“Has Kenneth… Um…” Bryce straightened his throat once more. He was annoyed with himself, he was feeling… ‘protective’ of Kenneth. Scared about the myriad of things that could make this excursion even MORE uncomfortable for him. “S—Smith, I order you to assist Paulson with his ‘personal matters’ now, before the train comes!”

Kenneth’s face immediately flamed red. “Wh—Why are you being so loud!?” He snapped. “And I already— I handled it before we CAME h—“

Dwight touched Kenneth’s back gently, whispering to him, “It probably IS a good idea to try and do it again…” he said. “Just in case.”

He led Kenneth towards the restrooms, relieved to see no one milling around near them. Once inside, Dwight held onto Kenneth like he usually did, kneading his shoulders.

Kenneth tried to use the toilet, but he didn’t really need to go. He could feel, perhaps, a small bit of pressure tingling within him, but hardly enough to convince his muscles to cede. He shut his eyes, attempting to relax. He knew it really WOULD be for the best if he boarded the train completely empty, not even a drop locked away in his bladder, he just couldn’t DO it, though.

“Mmmf,” Kenneth bit down on his lip, straining against himself. He felt some heat at the base of his length and thought MAYBE something else would follow, but it didn’t. The thought of letting out a short trickle of liquid didn’t make him feel anxious like he usually did, he wasn’t fretting about the time wasted, about how he SHOULD be holding it in longer, about Father scolding him for peeing when he barely needed it.

His bladder just… Wasn’t used to emptying this frequently. He didn’t even feel its walls trying to squeeze like they did when he was truly locked up. If anything, those muscles felt kind of numb, like they didn’t know what was expected of them.

Kenneth DID worry when he realized that, thinking that there was a chance him constantly holding to his limit had rendered his bladder INCAPABLE of draining unless it was uncomfortably full…

“It’s alright, Kenneth,” Dwight said. “You’re safe, no one’s near the door, it’s alri—“

“I just don’t have to pee right now,” Kenneth interrupted.

“You’re sure?”

“I KNOW when I need to pee, Dwight…” Kenneth said.

So, they left. Dwight could tell Kenneth really WAS fine. He hadn’t been gnawing on his hands or shuffling around. And, it had only been an hour or so since he’d last urinated. It was reasonable to think he wouldn’t need it again so soon.

Dwight was just a little bit more concerned about Kenneth than usual today. Kenneth was ACTING like nothing in the world was bothering him, but Dwight didn’t think that would last. He didn’t see how it COULD last. As soon as they reached their hometown, as soon as all the memories were dumped on top of him at once, there was no telling what that would do to him.

The train arrived, and the three boarded it. The first few hours were uneventful. More boring than anything. Kenneth and Dwight talked while Bryce read. But, eventually they ran out of conversation topics, since the single biggest thing on both of their minds was being steadfastly ignored. Bryce couldn’t concentrate on his book so well either, the nagging feeling in the back of his mind taking precedence over everything else.

‘Only a couple hundred people…’ Why was that sticking with him so mu—

In a village so small, everyone KNEW everyone.

In a village so small, secrets couldn’t stay secret forever.

Someone had to have KNOWN.

Bryce had never seen photos of Kenneth as a child, but the injuries he’d received would have been visible. He would have been constantly bruised. His complexion would have been sallow. He would not have LOOKED like a healthy, well cared for child.

And, everyone in that town would have seen him. He was not kept locked inside twenty-four seven. He went outside, he MUST have gone outside in order to meet Dwight and become such close friends with him.

People would have noticed him.

They would have noticed and, for it to have continued like it did, they would have done absolutely nothing.

***

Kenneth looked out the window of the train. The view didn’t give him much idea of how close they were getting. Nothing to see except for long stretches of trees. Dread was churning in his chest the longer the journey went on, however. His skin felt tingly, and he was terribly itchy just below the surface. Since the feeling was underneath his skin, he wasn’t able to scratch it away. It just kept worsening.

Something else was worsening too. The longer he sat, lost in thoughts about where he was about to go, the more his bladder ached. Kenneth wasn’t used to the need getting this strong so fast. He knew the stress he was under must have been the cause of it, but that didn’t make it any less irritating.

He shifted his legs, crossing them at the ankles and rubbing them together. The pressure eased slightly, but not enough. He was going to have to pee soon, otherwise this might get painful.

This train did have a toilet. If he were normal, he could get up right now and use it. He wasn’t normal, though. And he was very self-conscious about how it would look if he entered the small bathroom with Dwight. He’d done that a couple times before, but today felt… Different. His back was twitching, nerves jittering through his entire body. He was fully alert to everything. It was like when he’d had coffee for the first time, but instead of making him feel excited and powerful, now the increased awareness and overflow of energy only set him on edge.

They weren’t even in town yet, but Kenneth could already hear memories of his Father’s voice shouting into his ears.

“You need to stop spending all your time clinging to that orphan boy. People are going to think you’re a fairy. And, if you think I treat you badly, just wait and see how EVERYONE ELSE will treat you for THAT.”

Kenneth would hold it until the next stop. It was far less likely anyone would notice him and Dwight going to the toilet together there.

He just hoped the next stop came soon. The anxious trills moving through him were convening around his bladder, squeezing against it roughly. He was shifting with discomfort, trying his best to keep his hands away from his mouth. If he started to chew on them, Bryce and Dwight would know what was bothering him.

In a weird way, Kenneth was kind of grateful for the need to pee. It served as a distraction from everything else that had been on his mind. His fears about returning ‘home’ were pushed aside in favor of thoughts like ‘I hope we stop soon’, and ‘It’s getting harder to hold it.’

In any other scenario, Kenneth would be trying NOT to focus his mind on his ever growing urge for relief, but when the only other things he could think of were even more unpleasant, he allowed himself to concentrate on the throbbing of his bladder. He knew it was a bad idea, giving the frantic tingles encircling the base of his cock his undivided attention would certainly make them worse. But, he was sure a stop WOULD be coming soon. He’d have a chance to empty his bladder before it got too agonizing.

Sure enough, the train arrived at a station only half an hour later. Kenneth had been subtly squeezing his thighs together that entire time, and tightened his muscles up even further as his bladder gave a stronger lurch. He bounced a knee before moving to stand up.

He’d been sitting in one position for such a long time that his nerve-endings all sprang to life from the sudden motion. The liquid that had been pressing itself against his opening surged against it, and the sensitive walls of his bladders contracted sharply. “Dwight,” Kenneth said. “Can we go outside for a minute? I— I really want to stretch my legs.”

Dwight stood and came to Kenneth’s side. He knew what Kenneth ACTUALLY wanted to do, and he was sure Bryce knew as well. It made him a little uneasy that Kenneth hadn’t told the truth this time— He’d been doing well at confessing his needs when only his friends were there to hear him. He hoped the pressure Kenneth was no doubt feeling wasn’t causing him to back-slide a little…

Bryce got up, “Guess I’ll go too,” he said. “Have to make sure you idiots make it back before the train leaves again.”

Dwight could tell that Bryce wasn’t telling the truth, either. Bryce’s ankles had been crossing quite a bit the last several minutes.

Dwight led them both off the train and towards the restroom. However, a sign notified them that it was out of order.

Kenneth finally started to worry. His need had become rather insistent, and his bladder had gone loose anticipating some relief. His sore holding muscles pulled taut, prompting him to bounce uncomfortably on his toes.

Dwight easily sensed Kenneth’s panic. He knew Kenneth wouldn’t be able to use the toilet that was ON the train— Hell, HE could barely manage that himself! He knew Kenneth had been holding it a while already, he knew the next stop wouldn’t come for a long time. But, there was a solution— A very easy one. The station was surrounded by trees. Kenneth would be able to water one if Dwight kept him calm. They’d done that plenty of times, and Dwight saw no reason that THIS one would be any different.

Kenneth gave Dwight a grateful look as he was ushered towards the trees. Bryce followed after them, then moved a few paces away once they’d stopped. Bryce’s stream began to flow easily a second later, managing to force a jealous whimper from Kenneth’s mouth.

Dwight sighed, annoyed. Whenever he and Kenneth both needed to pee, he ALWAYS held his own bladder until Kenneth had managed to get himself started. Urinating right in front of Kenneth when he was still fighting his body would just be cruel.

Maybe the hiss of Bryce’s release would help coax Kenneth’s bladder into unclamping, though. Dwight HOPED that would work.

He stood behind Kenneth and, once he’d heard the other’s zipper coming down, he placed his hands atop his shoulders. He began to rub, gently at first, and then putting more of his strength into it. Kenneth shuddered, jiggling in place. Not a drop had emerged from him.

“It’s alright, Kenneth,” Dwight said. “It’s just the three of us back here. You’re okay.” He continued to whisper into his friend’s ear, awaiting the moment Kenneth came apart and melted into his arms, shaking and letting out those delirious moans of thankful relief.

Nothing happened for several more seconds. This was taking a lot longer than usual. Dwight searched for any of the ‘signs’ that sometimes appeared right before Kenneth started to pee. But, Kenneth’s breathing wasn’t evening out, the tension Dwight could feel in his shoulders hadn’t let up at all.

“I’ve got you…” Dwight assured, trying not to let any of his own panic show. Why wasn’t this working? This morning, before they’d left the barrack, Kenneth had peed with no issue! And he was alone now, only near people he trusted…

Maybe he just didn’t want Bryce here now. Maybe that was all it was. After Bryce had finished, Dwight asked him to go wait back by the train, then he repeated to Kenneth that they were COMPLETELY by themselves. “Bryce left,” he said. “It’s just us now.”

Kenneth wriggled, stomping his feet in obvious frustration. “I—It won’t work,” he said. “And I… I really DO have to go now,” he admitted.

“I know,” Dwight told him. It was hard to keep a calm tone now. They were running out of time. The train was going to leave soon, and if Kenneth didn’t manage to relax… “You need to let it out, you’ll feel so much better… Just shut your eyes. Shut your eyes, and just focus on my voice, focus on the feeling of my hands.”

Kenneth clamped his eyes closed, and his jaw clenched up as well. He WAS focusing on Dwight’s voice. It and the aggravating waves of piss scorching in his midsection were the only things that EXISTED to Kenneth anymore. Ah, he had to pee so bad, but it was as though he’d been GLUED shut, no liquid able to make it out.

“Nnnh,” Kenneth whined in the back of his throat as his bladder swelled, convulsed, and then knotted up. He couldn’t go, he couldn’t go, he couldn’t go…

How close were they to his hometown, anyway? How close were they to—

They weren’t close to Father at all. They could NEVER be close to that man, because he was DEAD. At most, they may have been getting near his rotting corpse buried six feet underground. But they were NOT near HIM.

Ghosts didn’t exist. Kenneth had NEVER believed in such things. Father’s spirit wasn’t haunting that town, roaming through it just in case Kenneth ever visited it again. He was NOT going to see his Father when they arrived. It was impossible.

But, he’d see his Father’s house. He’d see the bar Father always went to. He’d see the streets he’d run down every time he’d attempted to escape from Father. He may see some of Father’s friends.

Father was dead, but the town was stained with him. He leaked into every crevice, he coated every surface.

Kenneth couldn’t pee. He desperately, DESPERATELY needed to, but he couldn’t. Everything was twisting up within him, everything ached, everything was so heavy. His bladder’s fullness was just one more discomfort he needed to endure.

Dwight’s chest clenched when he spoke; “The train is going to leave in a minute or so…”

Kenneth made a strangled sound as he forced himself to zip his pants back up. His bladder thrashed against the finality of that action, which was already frustrating as Hell since it had had PLENTY of time to actually release. But, when it released a protesting spurt into his boxers the INSTANT his clothing was all back in place, a fire lit deep inside Kenneth’s body.

Barely aware of himself, he kicked a foot against the tree he’d failed to make use of. He hadn’t been thinking, he was just so fucking mad, so when his bladder responded to the impact by spasming more harshly than ever he hadn’t even prepared himself for it. Another drizzle of pee burst forth, warming the material encasing his dick. His hands darted to crotch, first squeezing and then trying to unzip again— If he was leaking, maybe that meant he could go! That had never worked before, but he just NEEDED—

Dwight was rubbing his arm, “Shhh…” he said. “I know, I’m really sorry. You want to find your Mother’s friend, right?”

Right. Yes. That was what this was ALL about. Kenneth couldn’t pee now. Even if, by some miracle, he managed to start gushing furiously the millisecond he’d yanked his cock back out, he was FULL. By the time he was done, the train would have left.

“There’s… There IS a toilet on the train,” Dwight reminded as he walked Kenneth back towards it. “If it gets… Really bad for you, we can try it again there.”

It already WAS really bad for him… “But, someone will see us go in together…”

“I’ll act like I’m about to burst,” Dwight said. “They’ll just think we can’t wait on each other. It will be okay.”

They boarded the train again. Bryce could tell Kenneth hadn’t been successful, it was obvious in the way he moved, and the way he sat. He was jittery, his knees bouncing and rubbing, his hands going to his mouth. It made Bryce feel…

Okay, fine. It made him feel concerned. It made him feel genuinely fucking concerned for Kenneth, because he had a pretty good idea of why he hadn’t been able to pee while they’d been stopped. If Bryce was right, and Kenneth was so stressed about returning ‘home’ that it had kept him from peeing, then Bryce didn’t think relief was waiting for him once they’d reached their destination. He was imagining Kenneth not being able to go AT ALL the entire time they were there, having to just leave and give up on his quest for Ann in the hope that he’d FINALLY be able to urinate once he got far enough away.

Bryce wanted to try assisting Kenneth now. Bryce wanted to hold Kenneth the same way Dwight did, try to convince his body to let it out. But, if Dwight had failed, then Bryce was sure he had no chance of managing it.

He was also sort of guilty now. He’d emptied his bladder while they’d been stopped, just ASSUMING Kenneth would be doing the same thing in a few seconds. He should have waited. He should still be holding it too…

Kenneth now tried to IGNORE the pulsating of his bladder. He couldn’t believe he’d been ‘grateful’ for it earlier. It was really starting to hurt, and having no clue as to when he might RID himself of it was making the torment nearly unbearable. He was starting to feel the pangs in his back, severe enough that they were making him dizzy. His back pounded sharply at regular intervals, almost like he was being struck there over and over agai—

He actually WAS being struck there over and over again! They hadn’t gone back to their same spots from earlier, and now there was a small child behind them, repeatedly kicking the back of their seat.

Kenneth’s back was already aching from the severity of his desperation, he didn’t need to have the area jabbed, too! He tensed himself up, one hand gripping his trembling knee and the other occasionally pinning itself between his thighs. Anger had been surging through him since the first second his bladder had leaked back at the station, THIS was making it build up to a crescendo. He felt so much enraged heat flaring through him that he had to squirm even MORE to try to get rid of it.

He knew he had to tell the kid to knock it off, or say something to the boy’s father whom was sitting next to him. But, unless he managed to cool off first, he was guaranteed to just yell if he opened his mouth.

Dwight caught sight of Kenneth’s eyelid twitching, which was generally a precursor to one of his fits. “I know, I feel it too,” he whispered. “Let me handle it, okay?” He turned and addressed the father; “Could you tell your son to stop kicking?” He asked.

The father shrugged, and repeated Dwight’s request to the boy.

The kicking stopped. Kenneth’s back still felt like it was full of needles, the space beneath his ribcage flooded with stings, but at least it wasn’t getting clobbered into every couple seconds anymore.

That lasted about two minutes.

Then the child started up again.

Kenneth was startled by a ferocious jolt to his back, all of his muscles revolting at once and a few drops of pee getting pumped out into his boxers. He doubled forwards, both hands moving between his legs. A pained yelp fell from his lips before he could stop it. Then, still reeling from that, he was struck AGAIN.

Dwight patted his shoulder softly. “Do you want me to try taking you to the toilet?” He asked as quietly as he could.

The thought of standing up right now… He wasn’t even able to pry himself out of his hunched over position. Standing would probably kill him. He shook his head, eyes burning.

Bryce watched Kenneth coiling up, watching his body spasming each time he was kicked. The impacts certainly didn’t feel pleasant to Bryce, either, but HE wasn’t also desperate to pee. This must have been torturing Kenneth…

Bryce turned, “Can you give that kid something else to do?” He asked the father. Simultaneously, he was glancing around the train. There didn’t seem to be any other available seats they could move to.

The father, again, told his son to stop.

Again, it only lasted for about a minute.

Then, the boy landed a kick that hit directly beneath Kenneth’s ribs, colliding with the soft, vulnerable flesh there and making him jump out of his seat before doubling over, hissing through his teeth as he clutched at himself frantically with both hands. Holding himself, obviously desperate, his back igniting and flooding him with equal parts rage and agony. Endorphins flared through him, blurring his vision, and then—

“God dammit!” Kenneth exploded, just not in the way his body so desperately needed for him to. He whirled around, glaring down at the kid.“Can’t you just knock that off?! I’ve had enough! Stop kicking me!”

The little boy shrank back, his eyes welling. As the tears started to glide smoothly down his cheeks, an immense weight settled onto Kenneth. The child was terrified of him. The child thought he was going to hurt him. And, worst of all, for a brief second there, Kenneth had sort of WANTED to make him cry.

“I… I’m sorry…”

The father stood up, and at his full height he dwarfed Kenneth, “You’ve got no business talking to my son that way!” He yelled. “He’s just a kid, he doesn’t know any better!”

Kenneth shook, his lungs felt like they’d just stopped working. He couldn’t breathe. His bladder was broiling, his urethra stinging as though it had been lined with chili flakes. He didn’t want to be here anymore. He wanted to be back in his room, where he could pee, and where he was away from other people. He didn’t belong around other people, he couldn’t control himself. He was dangerous. He was just like his Father.

That was probably the real reason his bladder behaved the way it did. His body recognized that he wasn’t fit for human interaction, so it made certain that he couldn’t BE in public for very long without pain. His body knew that he belonged locked away somewhere by himself, forever. It was the only way to keep others safe from him.

“Get a grip,” the boy’s father snarled. “You psychopath.”

The little boy’s frown vanished immediately, replaced with snickering laughs.

Bryce and Dwight got up as well. Dwight gripped Kenneth’s arm, wishing he could take his hand instead. Bryce tried to speak; “I’m sorry, he… He gets motion sickness really easily, and the kicking—“

“That’s not an excuse,” the father interrupted. “You know, a person like him isn’t even fit to wear that uniform, it’s disgusting they’d even give him one. There are other places that are a better fit for him, like a padded cell in a lunatic asylum.”

Kenneth nodded. He did belong there. He thought of the story Elizabeth had told about her neighbor that had been sent to one of those places. When he’d come back, he hadn’t been any better off, he’d just been hurt. Kenneth knew there really WAS no ‘fixing’ what was wrong with him though. He couldn’t get better. He was a psychopath. He deserved to be hurt. He deserved to be held down and shocked. He deserved to have his head cut open and parts of his brain removed. Even though it wouldn’t make him better, it would at least keep him away from others.

“He’s not feeling well,” Bryce said. “C—Come on, Kenneth, I brought anti-nausea medicine. It will be okay…” He and Dwight led Kenneth down the aisle. Bryce wasn’t sure where to take him, but when they reached the door to the toilet, he said “E—Even if you can’t go, let’s get you a few minutes of quiet, okay?”

Dwight was shaking. He wanted to go into the restroom with Kenneth, to try again to get him relief from at least ONE of the things that was upsetting him so badly. But, Dwight wasn’t calm at all now. He couldn’t make Kenneth calm if he didn’t first feel that way himself. That man had said such horrid things, way worse than what Kenneth had said to the kid…

Bryce noticed how jittery Dwight was. “I’ll… Come on, Kenneth,” he said once more, taking him into the restroom. It was tiny, super cramped especially with two people inside it. He knew Kenneth got scared in tight spaces… “It’s okay,” Bryce told him. “Nice and quiet in here, just—“ He stopped abruptly, realizing that Kenneth had been silently crying, tears rolling down his face as he shook soundlessly. “Kenneth, it’s okay…” he repeated. “You’re under a lot of stress right now, I understand why you got angry…”

Kenneth didn’t respond.

“It’s alright…” Bryce gave him an awkward hug, wary of pushing boundaries again like he had on Christmas. Kenneth didn’t push him away, so he kept going, rubbing his twitching back, knotted with tension all down his spine. He wanted to try to get rid of at least a PIECE of it. “Okay, let’s try to pee,” he said.

“I can’t…” Kenneth croaked out. Most likely, when he went to the asylum, he wouldn’t have much privacy. He’d be monitored most of the time. He’d never be able to go. He didn’t deserve to be able to go.

“Shhh… You can,” Bryce encouraged. “You need to.”

“I— I NEED to go to an asylum,” Kenneth said.

“No,” Bryce said. “You don’t… We talked to Elizabeth about that, they try to help, but I don’t think they know what to do. Maybe one day they’ll figure it out, but right now—“

“I kn—know it won’t help me, but I shouldn’t… I shouldn’t be near people,” Kenneth said. “I should be locked up.”

“No, Kenneth…” Bryce said. “Dwight would be really sad if that happened… Come on, let’s see if you can pee now, okay?”

Sniffling, Kenneth unzipped himself and aimed. Nothing happened, but he didn’t feel any frustration or disappointment. He didn’t even feel any real increase in his desperation, either. He just felt dim acceptance. This was what happened. This was what always would happen. This was what he deserved. His punishment for turning into Father.

“I’m like him,” Kenneth said after a moment of Bryce trying to soothe tension from his shoulders.

“Hm?”

“I’m just like my Father.”

“You aren’t…” Bryce insisted. “If you were, you wouldn’t feel so bad right now.”

“I’m a psychopath.”

“You got mad because someone wouldn’t stop kicking you while you were desperate to pee,” Bryce said. “That doesn’t make you a psychopath, that makes you a human. It’s alright… Just let it out…” He kept stroking Kenneth’s neck, back and shoulders until finally a slow, dismal stream started to patter out. “There you go…” he said. “That’s good. Keep doing that.”

Kenneth pushed, trying to make it come out faster so that he might actually FEEL some relief, but it took several more seconds before he was able to manage that, then he started to shake in a much more contented manner. “Ahhhhh….”

“That’s better…” Bryce encouraged, feeling Kenneth going limp. He had to hold onto him a little tighter, worried that the release was making his legs go a little too weak to actually support himself. It felt weird gripping him so firmly, but not in a bad way. “All better…”

Kenneth allowed himself to get lost in the bliss of letting go, trying not to think about that man’s words, his angry outburst, his upcoming destination. He tried to think only of peeing, and of how good it felt to finally do it.

That worked, but when he was completely drained out a minute later, all the bad feelings came back. He zipped himself up and turned around to hug Bryce again, burying his face into the taller man’s chest.

Bryce kept holding him, stroking his back up and down. He knew he needed to stop. Dwight was probably already feeling some jealousy over the fact that Bryce had gotten Kenneth to pee instead of HIM. If he started cuddling with Kenneth, even if it was only because Kenneth BADLY needed comfort, Dwight would feel worse.

Kenneth pulled away a moment later, “Thank you…” he said.

Bryce stared at Kenneth’s chapped lips, which were raw and bitten thanks to his desperation. In spite of that, Bryce yearned to press his own lips against them. Even if just for a second, just so that Kenneth would know that there were two people in the world who loved him and didn’t think he deserved to be ‘locked up’.

Bryce didn’t, though. Kenneth belonged to Dwight, and Bryce… He loved Dwight, too. It was so confusing. He loved Kenneth, he loved Dwight, and he loved Elizabeth. He loved them all equally, and in a perfect world, they’d all be together. But, that wasn’t how it worked in real life. People didn’t do things like that.

Dwight took Kenneth’s wrist once they were out of the restroom. “Did you manage to go?”

“Yes,” Kenneth said.

Bryce waited for that jealous look to come over Dwight’s face, but it didn’t. Instead, he just looked relieved. “Good… Thank you, Bryce. I couldn’t have done it that time.”

They managed to find some vacant seats away from that man and his son, and the rest of the trip passed by calmly. When they arrived at the station closest to Kenneth and Dwight’s village, it was dark out. They still had quite a way left to walk, so they decided to wait until morning.

They checked into an inn in the closest town. There was just one room left available, and it only had a single bed. Bryce said “We’re all exhausted, two of us can just sleep on the floor,” and took the key.

But, assuming Kenneth and Dwight didn’t mind it, he thought it would be okay if they all shared the bed. They’d done it before, after all.

In their room, Bryce and Kenneth took turns relieving their bladders and showering. But, Dwight was so tired that he passed out almost immediately, laying in the center of the bed. Once Kenneth and Bryce were ready to go to sleep, Kenneth was the one to say it was alright if Bryce joined him and Dwight in the bed.

Kenneth climbed in and nuzzled up to Dwight, snuggling close. Bryce got in on Dwight’s other side. Hesitantly, he reached over Dwight’s body to squeeze Kenneth’s hand gently, and before long they were all asleep.

*125*2023-04-19 01:48

Dwight wished he could remember what had led up to this. Even if these new regulations he was supposed to follow had apparently never been put up to a vote, he thought he should have been able to recall some kind of announcement about them.

But, he couldn’t.

He also couldn’t remember when The Leader had stepped down from his position, something he was certain should have been big news. Nor could he remember how in the world Karl, of all people, had taken his place.

Dwight did know that all of these things were true, he just lacked a memory of why. But, maybe he had a good reason to be suffering from a bout of amnesia— He was in so much pain that he could barely think.

“Smith,” a stiff, higher-ranking guard said as he glowered down at Dwight, staring straight at the feet Dwight was trying not to bounce. “I’m giving you one last warning, you are in violation of almost every public decency regulation.”

Dwight balled his hands into fists, clenching and un-clenching them at his sides. He managed to make his feet go still, and very nearly even got himself to uncurl from his hunched over posture. But, not quite, and before he knew it, one leg was inching atop the other. “S—Sir,” he pleaded, his expression filled with urgency. “I need—“

“You NEED to familiarize yourself with the law again,” the other guard cut him off. “Your Urination License was revoked.” He displayed the card he’d ripped from Dwight’s hand a moment ago.

“But, but, it’s not supposed to—“

“REVOKED,” the guard repeated. “Meaning GONE, FORBIDDEN. You’re not permitted to access ANY facilities in this country since your track-record of obeying the law has been so abysmal.”

Dwight’s whole body shook and his eyes began to burn painfully.

“What the fuck is wrong with you?! You’re an adult, don’t you dare cry— And stop crossing your god damned legs! Hey, you know what? You can just come with me.”

***

Dwight had little memory of the walk to the jailhouse. He knew it must have been very painful, going such a long distance with such a full bladder. It must have been so awful that he’d blocked it all out. Just, one second, that guard was shouting at him and, the next, he was being shoved through the door of the jailhouse.

Perhaps the main reason he blotted it out was because he was almost HAPPY when he got through the doorway. Kenneth was there, sitting behind a desk… But, gnawing the absolute FUCK out of his hands. He was desperate— Of course he was desperate, the regulations had been absolute Hell for him— but since most people didn’t realize that for Kenneth, hand-chewing was a SIGN of desperation, no matter how much he did it he never got in trouble for violating the rules.

“Sir,” Kenneth said to the unknown, superior guard. “What is happening now?” He bit down on his lip. Dwight could tell he wanted to say something different, wanted to demand the guard let Dwight go— In more ways than one.

“Paulson,” the other guard said. “Smith here was caught engaging in multiple violations of the law— Public displays of desperation being a big one.”

Dwight fought not to start stomping his feet and committing ANOTHER violation of that rule. He had to grind his teeth together to keep from vocalizing his need. That had been the toughest habit of his to break; Voicing aloud that he needed to pee had always been so helpful, but now it wasn’t allowed. He instead just kept screaming it inside his mind. ‘Gotta peeee! Need to peeeeeeee! Please, please, please, I wanna pee! Now!’

It didn’t help.

Kenneth wrote something down, his teeth sinking even more firmly into one of his knuckles. His eyes were big and watery as he looked at Dwight. Dwight wished he could go to him, wished he could hold him, cuddle him, the way they used to do before the regulations had barred them from having any contact.

“T—Take him through…” Kenneth managed, blinking hard, but not fast enough to stop one tear from going down his cheek.

The other guard started to drag Dwight to a door in the back of the room. “Stop your squirming!” He barked.

Dwight started to cry in earnest, “I can’t help it! I need to—“

“You don’t need to do jack shit, aside from holding yourself fucking still and going through that god damned door!” The guard snapped, forcing Dwight through the next doorway.

Suddenly, Dwight was in a small court-room, and already standing in front of the judge. Being shouted at like that must have upset him so much that it had clouded up his vision for the last couple minutes.

He must have already been here for a bit, too, because the judge already knew his name. “Smith,” he said. “If you don’t hold still, we won’t be able to continue with this trial. If I see your legs cross one more time, I swear…”

Dwight cringed, forced his legs apart, and felt an awful heat right at the base of his dick. Fuck, he couldn’t keep it in, not without at least SOMETHING to ease the pain… Maybe— Maybe Kenneth’s thing would work for him too this time! He stuffed a finger into his mouth and bit it. His sharp teeth digging into the skin hurt a lot, but the pain actually served as a distraction.

“Very well…” the judge said. “Now, what are the charges?”

The guard who’d brought Dwight here spoke next. “Smith is charged with attempted unlawful urination, public displays of desperation, and— STOP CROSSING YOUR FUCKING LEGS!”

“Smith!” The judge shouted. “You have consistently violated the law since you set foot inside this courtroom, keep it up and see what happens!”

Dwight tried to go still, managed it for the most part, but his body continued to violently vibrate from painful levels of tension. “C—Can I have a lawyer?”

“A lawyer?” The judge repeated with a laugh. “Where the Hell do you think you are right now? Defense Attorneys were made illegal when Grand King Emperor Lord Karl came to power three years ago!”

It had really been THAT long…? Why couldn’t Dwight remember—

“Now, can we continue with this trial?” The judge asked.

“We can continue once Smith STOPS bouncing up and down like that,” said the guard.

The judge banged his gavel several times, angrily. The sound was sharp and piercing enough that it nearly made Dwight pee. “Alright! Fine!” The judge snapped. “Clearly we can’t do this tonight. Maybe a night in the cell will sort him out!”

The next thing Dwight knew, he was locked into a tiny room. It was a bit like the holding cells they’d kept enemies in back when… Back when he’d worked with Kenneth and Bryce and Karl hadn’t been in charge of everybody. Except, this one didn’t have a bed— and it definitely didn’t have a toilet. Instead, it just housed a chair, with thick, tight straps that went right over the occupants lap— Directly over their bladder. There were gears in the floor, and every few minutes, those gears would move to yank the straps down even tighter.

It was Hell.

Dwight was supposed to stay here all night.

To make it worse, a massive bottle of water was hanging down from the ceiling— Similar in appearance to the ones used for pet rodents, except WAY bigger. The spout was positioned at-level with Dwight’s mouth, and if morning came and he hadn’t managed to finish it, it would be re-filled and he’d have until the next day to try again.

As Dwight forced himself to guzzle the water, he wriggled painfully in the confining chair, and let the tears roll down his cheeks every time the straps squeezed more sharply into his bladder. He tried to guess how much water was IN the bottle. Looking at it, it was at least as big as his entire body was— Maybe even bigger! He had no idea how it would be physically possible for him to fit it all into himself.

But, he didn’t have a choice other than to try. If he didn’t get it all down by morning, he wouldn’t even have a CHANCE to urinate for at least one more day. And, if he had an accident… What happened if he had an accident? He tried to remember…

Right… Right… The NEW rule, now that Karl ran the country, was if someone had an accident, then they got a plug shoved into themselves so that they could never, ever pee again. Dwight shuddered with fear and continued to drink. How in the world had he forgotten THAT?

At some point in the night, as Dwight sucked on the bottle, he was finally getting nothing more out of it. He’d drained the thing in time, and now it was all going through his body, all rushing down to a container that was already so, so painfully full… A moment later, he heard the sickening grind of the gears, felt the strap digging in more, felt his bladder sob.

He sobbed with it.

***

Dwight must have somehow managed to get to sleep, because all of the sudden he was back in front of the judge again, staring up at him blearily. His bladder must have been making him delirious, strange shapes were appearing in the corners of his vision, and when the judge spoke he sounded very, very far away.

“Smith,” the judge began. “I hope your time in the holding cell taught you a bit of a lesson. Are you ready to cooperate with us this morning?”

Dwight said nothing. The only thing he wanted to say was “Please, please let me use the toilet now, please!” But, such a phrase was against the law. He’d be sent back to the cell, strapped to the chair again, given another enormous water bottle to shove into his overburdened body.

“Now, of course, we’ve had to upgrade your charges, since yesterday’s behavior delayed court proceedings…” the judge continued. “Your charges are now attempted unlawful urination, public displays of desperation, and contempt of court…”

When Dwight looked down at himself, he was stunned by what he saw. His middle was swollen. It was BEYOND swollen. The hard, round lump in his core was bigger even than anything he’d ever seen in Kenneth’s abdomen! He looked like he had swallowed a volleyball…

“Now, how do you plead?” The judge asked him.

“N—Not guilty, due to… um… circumstances?” Dwight asked. He wished that he was allowed to have a lawyer… He had no idea what he was even doing! He thought what he’d just said SOUNDED lawyer-y though. Maybe it would work!

“Hmmm,” the judge said. “Guard?”

The guard from the previous day stepped forward. “Yesterday, it was reported that a man matching Smith’s description was publicly displaying signs that he desperately desired to relieve his bladder, and that he was using various inappropriate methods to assuage the discomfort. I went to check out the scene, and found Smith in the process of unzipping his pants beside a tree. His intentions were clear, and in obvious violation of the law.”

Dwight’s eyes watered again. If only that guard had taken a few extra minutes to show up, then Dwight could have used that tree, he could have freed himself from the Hell of his need…

“Later investigation showed that there were various attempts to pass off a revoked urination permit card at numerous male restrooms in the surrounding area.”

Dwight could sort of remember that now, too. He’d showed his card to a bunch of different shop owners, and they’d all told him it had been suspended and so he wasn’t allowed to go, but none of them had explained why…

The judge looked back at Dwight. “Did you squirm or hold your genitalia in public?”

“Y—Yes…”

“Did you attempt to relieve yourself onto a tree?”

“Yes…”

“And, when you attempted to gain access to urination facilities, were you informed that your permit had been revoked?”

“Yes.”

“So, what ‘circumstances’ lead you to believe you aren’t guilty?”

“I— I— When I tried to go on the tree… I hadn’t… I hadn’t peed in thr—three days…” Dwight sniveled, feeling every hour, every minute, every SECOND of that time weighing down on his aching, tortured urethra. “A—And I wasn’t told why my per—permit was revoked.”

“The reason is unimportant,” the judge said. “You should have gone through the proper process to acquire a new one, and then you would have received it within the next two-to-four months.”

Dwight’s bladder rolled inside of him, doing cartwheels, kicking all of his other organs and making him feel like he was about to vomit. He leaned forward, legs wobbling, trying to keep them from crossing. “Y—You can’t expect a person to— To hold it for months and not ev—even tell them why…”

“The guard you saw when you came in?” The judge asked. “His name’s Paulson.”

Dwight fought not to say that he knew that. Fought not to say that he loved that guard with all his heart. Fought not to say that he could have put up with everything, every last one of the new urination rules, if he’d just been allowed to keep Kenneth in his life.

“He hasn’t relieved himself in a year,” the judge said. “He was caught voiding into bottles in his private quarters, came in here and gave a pathetic sob story about how ‘can’t go’ in the public facilities since they are always monitored. His permit was immediately revoked for four years, and if he lets out even a drop before then, he’ll be plugged for the rest of his life. That’s why he’s working here, he’s trying to get his sentence reduced.”

Kenneth… Kenneth hadn’t peed in over a year? He still wasn’t going to for a few more? How was Kenneth even still alive? How was he able to handle just— just SITTING there all day, unable to do anything to control his need apart from biting his hands? The judge must have been lying, even if the REASON for Kenneth’s punishment sounded plausible.

“So, yes,” the judge said. “We DO expect people not to void for a few months if that’s how long it takes for their new permit to get approved. You aren’t special, you don’t deserve ‘special’ rights that no one else gets to have. Your ‘circumstances’ are not worth this court’s time.”

“But, but I should be allowed to—“

“Nope,” the judge said. “No one is just ‘allowed’ to urinate. What’s next? Are you going to insist you have a ‘right’ to food, shelter, or medical care? No, of course not. These things are meant to be earned, and you haven’t earned them.”

“But, it’s been four days, I—“

“Four days should be nothing to a man who’s in good health. If you cannot manage such a short hold, then I barely even know WHAT to say to you. Your entitlement is disgusting.”

“But— I’m— I’m not weak, it’s just— I need to go, please!”

“I don’t care what you think you ‘need’. And if you keep talking like that, your sentence is going to be worse, so I’d shut up if I were you. Or would you like to be plugged?”

Dwight went quiet, he tensed up his thighs. It felt like something inside of his body was slipping down… His leg started to twitch, and he nearly allowed to cross over the other one, he was just barely able to restrain the urge.

“Okay then,” the judge said. “Your sentence is as follows; You will be required to drink a minimum of ten liters of water per day, and you are now only allowed to void once a fortnight. But, these rules will only be put into place after you have served your sentence here in the jailhouse, which will consist of six months of retention. Releasing one drop of urine before the sentence is up will result in your fluid intake doubling and your voiding being limited to once per month. Any further infractions will earn you a plug and a permanent ban from urination for the remainder of your life.”

Dwight didn’t understand. The judge said all of that as if it were normal! As if it were physically possible! He couldn’t go two weeks without peeing, especially if he drank TEN liters of water every day! And… And now he was supposed to keep holding it for six more months, or else his punishment would be DOUBLED? He looked at the guard who’d brought him in. He TOO was behaving like all of that was just expected and okay.

How— How the fuck was he supposed to— He needed to go NOW, he couldn’t understand why he hadn’t peed his pants yet already! He wanted to go talk to Kenneth! Kenneth must have figured something out, because there was no WAY he’d seriously been holding it for an entire year, he wanted Kenneth, he wanted—

Suddenly, Dwight found himself inside another jail cell. This one was more normal looking. It had a bunk bed and a sink, but no toilet of course. He, again, couldn’t remember how he’d gotten here. He must have just freaked out so badly when he’d heard his sentence that he blacked out again.

Now, he was sitting on the lower bunk, gripping his crotch and flailing all over the place. At least, he was permitted to squirm and do anything else he had to do when he was in the cell, it was considered a ‘private space’, so the rules against public displays of desperation didn’t apply. He was free to jump around, grasp his dick, cross his legs, sob, and babble incomprehensible strings of desperate begging. “Please, please, please, I need to go nooowwwwww… I can’t wait, I can’t wait… I need to peeeeeee….”

From the other side of the cell, he heard Bryce’s voice. “Would you be quiet, Smith?” He hissed. “Listening to you doesn’t make it any easier on ME, you know!?”

Dwight jumped, and nearly let loose a spurt. He clamped his hand around his shaft painfully. If he let out even a drop, he’d be punished more… “Bryce?” He asked.

“Uh, yeah,” Bryce said, bobbing up and down, turning in circles and holding onto his dick with both hands. “We’ve been cellmates for three fucking days, idiot.”

O…kay… So, Dwight had already gone through three days of his sentence somehow. He’d just blacked them out. Thank goodness he hadn’t peed during that time! “Right… Right… I forgot because— Because I’m so—“

“I know…” Bryce grumbled. “And you have NO right to be— You only gotta wait six more months! They aren’t letting me go for ten more years!”

“Wh—What—“

“Yeah, halfway through my sentence now,” Bryce said.

What. The. Fuck. Bryce had ALREADY been holding it for ten god damned years?! From the size of the melon bloating out his abdomen, he looked like he might have been… But, he ALSO didn’t look ten years older from the last time Dwight had seen him. And… Wait… Hadn’t it ONLY been three years since the regulations were put in, anyway?!

Ughhhh, Dwight was so confused! And he just wanted to pee! He might be able to understand this stuff better if his middle didn’t hurt so badly!

There followed a whole lot of monotony. Dwight was led from his cell to a lunchroom three times every day. He wouldn’t be given any food, but for some reason he never got hungry, even as the days turned into weeks. He was only served huge bottles of water, most of them larger than his entire torso. He’d be forced to guzzle them all down fast. His bladder kept stretching, and becoming more painful, but somehow he didn’t ever spring a leak.

Eventually, the guards started to weigh him each morning and, in spite of the fact that he hadn’t eaten anything in over three months by then, he continued to gain weight. He knew all of the weight was just in his bladder, and it really scared him. He didn’t understand what was happening to his body, or how he was even still alive. Either the starvation should have killed him, or his bladder should have ruptured and murdered him by now.

During the fourth month, Dwight ceased to feel the severity of his need increasing. Which, he supposed, was how Kenneth and Bryce had been managing THEIR punishments. There was, apparently, just a point at which a bladder couldn’t FEEL any more full. It was still blazingly painful, and Dwight cried almost 24/7 from how much it hurt, but it had finally plateaued.

Partway through month five, Dwight realized that his sentence had passed a whole lot faster than he’d thought it would. He actually couldn’t remember most of it, just brief flashes of being forced to drink huge quantities of water, being weighed, and watching his bladder bulge grow. It was like the last few months had gone by in just the blink of an eye.

Near the end of the sixth month, Dwight was forced into the holding cell again for his final test. If he could handle another night in there, AND drink the enormous, human-sized water bottle again, he would be allowed to have his first pee in half a year. He was determined to do it, overcome by fantasies of how good it was going to feel to finally let it all out.

He sat down in the chair, and it was tricky for the guards to tie the straps around him this time, because he’d swelled up to such a ridiculous degree. When the belts were finally in place, the gears turned immediately and tightened them down over Dwight’s body. He whimpered and kicked his legs out, coiled them together, since that was all he could do to quell the urge. He was amazed that his pee dance maneuvers were still working, but they WERE; He still hadn’t let out a single drop in all this time!

He set to work chugging the water, reminding himself again and again that, if he got it down, he’d finally be able to let it all out…

He thought he managed to finish this bottle off a little faster than he’d handled the first one six months ago. All the guzzling he’d been forced to do in jail must have trained his throat muscles or something, because he was done with the massive bottle in what must have been just five minutes!

Except… Now he had to make it through the night. Just one more, awful, awful night. And nights went by slowly when a person had nothing to do. And even MORE slowly when that person had nothing to think about apart from a really, REALLY full bladder— and the fact that emptiness was at last on its way…

Dwight began to hear the sound of a dripping faucet, but was unable to figure out WHERE it was coming from. The noise drove him crazy anyway, made him shake and shudder in the chair. He was sweating profusely, his hair limply clinging to his forehead. The throbbing, burning, wailing pain was all consuming, encompassing his entire body, worse than anything he’d ever felt before in his life.

Finally, his back started to hurt. The awful, fiery scorch that Kenneth had so often sobbed to him about in the past. It was actually even WORSE than the ache in his bladder, making Dwight’s tears flow faster and faster. He hoped that at least some of his tears were actually piss finding an alternate route of escape from the Hell of his body.

His stomach hurt badly too. He was glad he hadn’t been fed in half a year, since it meant he had nothing to vomit out. Unless, maybe the piss was filling his stomach now too. And, maybe it was. Every nook and cranny inside of him was probably being flooded by his ocean of hot, boiling pee, all of it trying to blast out past his exhausted sphincters, shoot out his urethra and turn him into a human fire-hose.

Everything hurt… Everything hurt… He just wanted to go… Please, please, just let him—

The door to the cell opened, and two guards stepped in. “What do you know, he’s still dry!” One of them said.

“You owe me a coffee now,” the other said.

Dwight shut his eyes against the mention of liquid. It didn’t FEEL like he’d been in here for an entire night already, but he wasn’t going to protest. He was going to get to pee now, right? Please, please let him pee now… He needed a toilet, a urinal, a bowl… ANYTHING.

They released him from the chair, helped him to his feet, and told him they were taking him to a urination facility now. For the first time, Dwight DIDN’T black out as he was moved to a new location. As a result, he was forced to feel every horrific contraction that accompanied each step of his feet.

Luckily, the walk wasn’t that far, however. They’d brought him to a door beside all the jail cells, which he somehow hadn’t noticed in the months before. Good thing, too, because it was very, VERY clearly marked as a men’s restroom. It had a blue stick-figure, and below it was a super detailed diagram of a bladder emptying, which made Dwight hold onto his dick even tighter.

The guards opened the door and ushered him in. Inside, there was just a single toilet in the middle of a huge room. He was scrambling for it, but the guards ordered him to stop, reminding him that after a prison sentence, the first pee needed to be closely monitored.

Of course… How could he have forgotten that part!

Well, he didn’t mind…

“Stand beside the toilet,” the first guard told him.

Dwight did, bouncing in place and stomping his feet against the floor.

“Lift the lid.”

Dwight obeyed, the first drop of his burden finally leaking out at the sight of the open bowl.

“Pants down.”

Dwight was too desperate to hesitate. He didn’t even blush that hard as he unzipped his pants and pulled them down to his knees.

“Sit. But don’t go yet.”

Dwight lowered himself onto the toilet seat, stunned by how ridiculously comfortable it felt beneath him. Too comfortable… He was almost peeing… “Nnnnnhhhhh….”

“Request permission.”

“M—May I please go pee now?” Dwight begged. He was dying. He had never needed to go so much before. Being on the toilet just made it hurt so, so bad… “Please?”

“Yes.”

Before the word had even finished passing through the guard’s lips, it was swallowed up by what sounded like the most massive thunder storm to ever happen on planet Earth. There was no slow build up to Dwight’s release, it was coming out at full strength the instant it was finally allowed to exit his body. Dwight couldn’t help it, he moaned orgasmically, even louder and more intensely than Kenneth ever had! “Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh….!!!!!”

Relief… Beautiful, glorious relief at long, long last…. It felt so good… So good… So warm… So cozy…

Dwight snuggled against his pillow, pulling the blanket up more, and—

Dwight woke up, still basking in the warmth, in the relief, in the beautiful, beautiful looseness of his emptying bladder…

It took him a few seconds to put together that that was actually a PROBLEM. He was pissing like crazy, and it felt absolutely fucking amazing, but he was ALSO currently laying in bed. He was laying in bed with Kenneth to his left and… And Bryce on his right…

To make it worse, Dwight was FACING to the right, so a lot of the urine blasting from his spout was soaking into the back of Bryce’s pajamas.

Fuck, fuck, fuck! The consequences NOW were going to be even worse than the ones in his dream had been! Bryce was going to skin him alive, rip off his legs, and beat him to death with them! Dwight tried and tried to STOP going, even though SO much damage had already been done. But, he couldn’t, he couldn’t cork up his opening, couldn’t even restrain the flood back down to a dribble. It just kept coming and coming, drenching everything, and Dwight was paralyzed by the panic.

After another minute of uncontrollable, heavy spraying, Dwight was done. Weighed down by dismay, he struggled to sit up and assess the damage. His pants were absolutely soaked through, clinging stickily to his thighs. The blanket wasn’t much better off. The sheet below him was a mess. Bryce’s entire backside was coated in liquid, and some of it had managed to flow over to Kenneth’s side of the bed and get HIM pretty damp, too.

God dammit! He remembered what Kenneth had said the LAST time he’d gone through a bed-wetting phase, telling him NOT to pee if something felt too strange about his surroundings. And absolutely EVERYTHING about that dream had felt strange! The weird regulations, the unusual way time moved, the fact that he and everyone around him was going months or years on-end without peeing, all the little contradictions that kept cropping up… IN the dream he’d KNOWN those things were all weird yet, when he was told to sit down on the toilet and pee, he’d done it without a moment’s consideration. Nope, all he’d thought was ‘Oh, yay! I can pee now! Ahhh, that’s better!’

And now he’d drenched himself, the bed, Bryce, and Kenneth!

What… What could he do now? Kenneth didn’t usually get than angry over this, but Bryce…? No way would Bryce be alright with it. Dwight half wondered if, maybe, he could manage to change Bryce out of his wet pajamas and put new ones on him without waking him up. That could prevent Bryce from finding out, right?!

But, Bryce WOULD wake up. And he’d be WAY more upset if he woke to find Dwight trying to STRIP him immediately after he’d coated him in urine.

Ooooh, or maybe he could put Bryce’s hand in warm water, then Bryce would think it was just his OWN pee, and—

Then he’d be mad because Dwight had put his hand in warm water. Probably even ANGRIER since wetting the bed was an accident, but pranking someone else was a choice.

Dwight was just going to have to lay there and wait for Bryce to get up and punish him. Unless all the piss somehow magically evaporated before morning came.

Dwight couldn’t get back to sleep that night. He was so uncomfortable laying in his own bodily fluids, and the fear of the reactions that were sure to come didn’t help.

Eventually, Kenneth and Bryce woke up. Kenneth’s nose crinkled as the smell hit him. “Dwight,” he said groggily. “Did you—“ His eyes flickered wide open as he recalled what had happened last night. He lowered his voice to a whispering hiss “N—Not tonight… Please, tell me—“

Dwight was tearing up, “I didn’t mean to!” He said.

“Shh… Shhh…” Kenneth hugged him close, rubbed his back. “I know you didn’t… It’s—“

“Wha— What’s…” Bryce’s voice muttered out. “Why’m I all…”

“I’m sorry!” Dwight cried. “I— I had to go bad last night, and then I just fell asleep while Kenneth was— I’m sorry!”

Bryce blinked up at him blearily for several seconds, and then he figured it out. “Smith! Oh my God!” He sprang out of the bed and began to strip his shirt from his body. “Gross, gross, gross! If you piss the bed, you could have at least WARNED me!”

“I—It hadn’t happened in a long time! I thought it was—“

Bryce pealed the sodden pants down his legs, cringing hard. “Fucking Hell… How much did you— You soaked through all the way down to my boxers!” He turned. “And look at the bed, and you— You got Paulson wet, too?! How did you even…”

Kenneth had spun around the instant Bryce had started disrobing, and now called over his shoulder to him. “He didn’t mean to do this!”

“I— I get that!” Bryce said. “Nobody INTENDS to piss the bed, but if you’re gonna sleep WITH somebody—“

“I really thought I’d gotten past this!” Dwight protested. “It’s been months since the last time!”

“Only MONTHS?” Bryce repeated, he grabbed some clean clothes and stormed into the restroom, slamming the door closed.

Kenneth glared at the locked door. “Asshole…”

Dwight sighed, “He actually reacted a little better than I’d expecte—“

Kenneth paced up and down the length of the room. “And now he’s gone and locked himself in there when I haven’t yet… Done certain things that I need to do when I wake up…”

“…Oh,” Dwight said. “If… If you pee yourself, it won’t even be obvious since I already got your crotch all—“

“Dwight, please…” Kenneth interrupted, spinning around and tapping his feet harshly. “I know you’re trying to make me laugh, but if I laugh BEFORE I’ve had a turn in that room, it will not end well.”

Dwight went quiet. He’d just been trying to make this all less awkward, and joking around was generally how he accomplished that… “I’m… I’m really, really sorry. I was having this— This nightmare where Karl was in charge of the country. He put in all these rules about peeing, and we also weren’t allowed to talk to each other anymore for some reason.”

Kenneth frowned. THAT part sounded terrifying…

“And, I got arrested because I tried to pee on a tree, which was illegal in my dream. You were at the jailhouse, and they said you hadn’t peed in a year, and Bryce hadn’t peed in ten years… Then they didn’t let ME pee for six months, but then they finally let me, and—“

“Dwight,” Kenneth interrupted. “When you were LAST having trouble with bedwetting, what did I tell you?”

Dwight lowered his head shamefully. “That, if I’m about to go pee and something really weird is going on, I should pinch myself to make sure I’m awake first…”

“Yes, did you forget tha—“

“I—It’s not like I’m ever completely in control of what I do in a dream!” Dwight said. “I— I kept thinking the stuff was strange, but I never figured it out! I’m sorry!”

“I— I guess that IS true,” Kenneth admitted. “It’s not like I can always make myself wake up when I dream about Father…”

Bryce emerged from the restroom, now wearing nice, DRY clothes. “Smith, I would like to talk t—“ He was interrupted when Kenneth suddenly bolted past him and into the restroom. He heard the door slam and lock, some rustling, and then a bit of hissing and a LOT of sighing. “…Alright then… Guess I took his turn, huh?”

“Yeah…”

“I apologize for yelling at you,” Bryce said. “It’s just not a very pleasant surprise to wake up covered in piss, trust me. And especially not someone ELSE’S.

Dwight turned that over in his mind. “Trust y— Bryce, do you wet the bed, too?”

“NO!” Bryce snapped, enraged once more. “Of course I don’t!” With a huff, he turned away from Dwight. “But… I…USED to. When I was a kid. Sort of.”

“Sort of?”

“Okay, so it wasn’t like I just didn’t wake up in time,” Bryce explained. “But, my parents and I— We sorta lived in this huge, SUPER old place. I think it maybe used to be a castle, or something. I swear it was built back when the Plague was still going around. And, my room was at one end of this real long, narrow hallway, and the restroom was ALL the way at the other end. And, during the day, I didn’t mind the corridor that much. It was kind of tight, but that was fine. At night though, when it was DARK, and I already REALLY can’t see when it’s dark…”

“Were you scared to go down the hall?”

“I— Um— Maybe a little!” Bryce said. “O—Or maybe I just didn’t feel like taking such a long walk, or—“ He groaned. “Okay, fine. I was scared of how it looked at night. And, if I woke up wanting to use the toilet, then I’d sort of… Peek out my door, and maybe make it a few steps before a shadow or a creak made me go back. Then I’d try to go back to sleep and hold it until morning. Sometimes I DIDN’T hold it until morning…”

“Heh… Awwww… That’s almost kind of—“

“I—It’s not cute!” Bryce protested.

“It is,” Dwight said. “Poor little Bryce…”

Bryce grumbled to himself. “If you EVER tell Paulson, I swear to God…”

“I won’t,” Dwight said.

“Tell me what?” Kenneth asked, coming out of the restroom.

“NOTHING!” Bryce barked. “I order you to forget about—“

“Oh, did Bryce pee the bed once, too?” Kenneth guessed.

“NO!” Bryce yelled. “I’ve never peed the bed in my life, and I’m never GOING to!”

*126*2023-05-11 00:08

The walk to his home village was an hour long, but Kenneth wished it had been even longer. It was as though cold, ghostly hands wrapped themselves around each of his limbs the closer he got to it. When, suddenly he was back inside of it, something weird was happening in his body. It felt like his hand was being squeezed tightly in someone’s fist. It thundered, pounding so hard that it hurt, slamming around in the prison of his chest.

Dwight took his hand and squeezed it upon noticing his shakes and shortness of breath. “You okay…?”

“I’m as okay as I can be,” Kenneth managed to say. This place hadn’t changed a bit since he’d left it. As far as he could see, everything looked the same. No new buildings, no fresh coats of paint. It was still the same drab, dilapidated place in which he’d grown up, doubtless populated by the same people he’d walked by as a child. People who surely must have assumed something was wrong, when he always appeared so sallow and battered. They must have known. They all must have known.

They did nothing.

In fact, a lot of them did worse than nothing. Father’s lie about bravely trying to save Mother from an armed burglar had cast him as a hero. And that was exactly how some people around here viewed him. He was a poor, unfortunate man who’d tried his best to rescue his wife from an unknown attacker, and then was left on his own to bring up a child.

But, people must have noticed.

They DID notice.

There was a day where Father had been preparing to lock him inside the box again. Kenneth barely even fit into it by that point. His legs had to bend in a way that felt unnatural, like his joints were being moved out of place, his arms too. The thought of spending another several days confined in that cramped, dark place, unable to move any of his limbs, had sent a shockwave of terror through him. And, he did something he’d never done before, he tried to escape the house before Father could enact the punishment.

For a second it seemed like he might get away. Though he was weak and mutilated, he ran really fast, powered by the terror growing steadily in his heart. Father didn’t try to stop him until he’d reached the front door and yanked it open. The bright light of the sun had engulfed the room, and he was going to escape.

Hope had surged inside of him for the briefest of moments, he flung himself through the door and onto the porch before collapsing down the front steps. Father was on him in an instant. Kenneth screamed, thrashing madly against Father’s tight hold. Kenneth saw windows opening in other houses, front doors as well. Neighbors stepping out to stare at the spectacle. Kenneth shouted and begged for help, as Father yanked him back inside.

“Help!” Kenneth begged at the top of his voice, wishing that just ONE of the on-lookers would do something. Even if they just SAID anything, any acknowledgement that they saw what was happening and knew it was wrong.

He didn’t even receive THAT much. Just more gawking. He swore one of the on-lookers was even smiling, like he was just a silly child who didn’t want to sit in time-out, or something. Like, his ghostly white complexion wasn’t there, like he wasn’t covered in bruises from his forehead down to his toes. Like, the terror in his eyes wasn’t real.

Father slammed the door shut as soon as they were through it. “You stupid fuck!” Father shouted, tossing Kenneth to the ground and beginning to wail on him. “You’re just gonna run away? After all I’ve done for you!” His fists kept crashing down, over and over. Kenneth couldn’t even tell where they were landing, because his entire body already hurt so badly. “What was that?! You— You fucking humiliated me! Out there, screeching like a psychopath in front of everyone! What is WRONG with you?!”

Minutes later, Kenneth was being shoved into the box prison he already knew so well.

He was left in it for three days. No toilet breaks, but no water either, so in the end it didn’t matter so much. He couldn’t move at all. At one point, he felt gravity changing suddenly, then like the world had fallen out from under him, before a brutal slam shook the walls of his cell. Pain erupted all through one of his sides, and Kenneth knew he’d just been thrown against a wall.

When he was let out, he couldn’t stand up properly. He walked with a hunch for the next few weeks. Some of the neighbors who’d witnessed him being dragged inside that day also later got to see his awkward, stooped walk. He noticed them staring. They said nothing.

No one ever said anything.

No one ever did anything.

Now, Kenneth walked with his head down. He was scared of what he would do if he saw someone that he recognized. He pictured himself grabbing them, shaking them and just screaming, demanding to know what it was that had made them think he was so worthless.

What if he found Ann, and it turned out she was one of those people?

Dwight squeezed his hand again. “H—Hang on,” he said.

“Where do we start looking?” Bryce asked.

Kenneth shrugged. “Sh—She was at the church a lot,” he said. “Maybe there.”

“Alright,” Dwight said. “That’s where we’ll go.” He was struggling to think of how to get there, though. He remembered exactly where it was, in a place this small it was hard to get lost. But, to get to it, there weren’t any routes that would allow them to bypass one particular street. He was about to suggest they check a different location first, but the only thing he could think of was to return to the orphanage where he’d been raised, ask the nuns if they had ever known Ann.   And, to get to the orphanage, they’d still have to go down that same street.

“Kenneth, you remember where the church is, right?” Dwight asked.

“Y—Yeah, I’m…” Kenneth nibbled his lip, still staring down at his feet. “I’m g—good with directions.” He tried to smile. “I can tell left from right, unlike you.”

Dwight attempted a smile as well. “And… To get there, we have to…”

“I know…” Kenneth said. “Maybe… Maybe they tore it down. By the time I— By the time I left, it was falling apart…”

Bryce had a good idea of what the ‘it’ Kenneth was referring to may have been. “Paulson— Kenneth… You don’t have to do this. Dwight and I, we can look for Ann. You go back to the inn, we’ll find h—“

“No,” Kenneth shook his head. “I want to meet her… If… If my Mother loved her, then that has to mean there were SOME people in this town that weren’t monsters.”

Bryce nodded. “But, if you can’t do this—“

“I have to,” Kenneth said.

They walked on. They passed the main street, where all the shops were. Kenneth tried not to look at them. He remembered some of the shopkeepers, he remembered seeing them act all friendly with his Father, he’d seen them trying not to glance in his direction as he timidly stood at the man’s side. They didn’t care, and they had to actively TRY not to care, to pretend that they didn’t notice.

One of the doors opened, and a man stepped out. A man Kenneth recognized. He could recall that he’d caught Kenneth trying to steal a glass bottle of juice after not being given any water for two days. Father had apologized to him, explaining that Kenneth’s behavior had been out of control, and that he only responded to a certain kind of discipline. “Oh, I understand,” the man had agreed, shaking Father’s hand. “Kids can be little terrors at that age.”

It took everything in his power not to literally growl at that man now.

“Hey,” the shopkeeper waved to him, smiling. He was fucking smiling, like he hadn’t knowingly stood beside Kenneth’s abuser every week, treating him like he was his best friend. “I remember you, you were Francis’s kid, right?”

Kenneth flinched at the sound of his Father’s name. “Yes…” he said. He wanted to keep moving, but he felt like he was stuck.

“I was surprised you left town,” the shopkeeper said. “Most people born here end up staying their whole lives.”

His jaw set, Kenneth said; “I needed a change of scenery.”

“I understand,” the shopkeeper nodded, just like he had the day Kenneth had tried to steal the juice. “After your Father… Did what he did, I’d want to leave too.”

Kenneth felt even more frozen up. So, he knew PRECISELY why Kenneth hadn’t wanted to stay here. Why did he even BOTHER—

“Do you think you knew… I mean, were there any signs before it happened?” The shopkeeper asked. “A lot of us were surprised when we heard, but I guess he did start drinking more after he lost his— Well, after what happened with your Mother.”

Oh. He was referring to Father’s ‘suicide’. Kenneth was relieved to learn everyone apparently believed that that HAD been his cause of death. The day Kenneth had shot his Father, he’d painstakingly searched through Father’s journals until he found an entry that sounded appropriately depressed. With the melancholic page scrawled out in Father’s handwriting left near the body, and the gun carefully rested beneath his hand, it would be easiest for everyone to assume he’d shot himself.

Kenneth tried to imagine how he SHOULD react in this situation. If, like he wanted everyone to believe, he’d gone out to spend time with his best friend and returned home to find his Father had ended his own life, leaving behind nothing but a vague note. “I… Wish I had noticed the signs,” he said. “Maybe I could have talked him out of it.”

“Oh, don’t blame yourself,” the shopkeeper said. “Sometimes these things happen.” His smile disappearing, he looked directly into Kenneth’s eyes as he continued; “Sometimes, we wish we could go back and do something differently, but all we can do is accept that it’s too late to change it.”

Kenneth tried not to meet his gaze. “I don’t have any regrets about how I left this place— If I had the chance, I’d do the same thing over again.”

The shopkeeper stared at him for a second, then he gave a slight, barely perceptible nod of his head. He was about to head back into his store when he stopped himself. “You want to know something? Your Father had this… I don’t know what you’d call it, an aura, I guess. It was very cold. When he came into the store, it was always like the temperature dropped a few degrees. Whatever happened to— Whatever made him do what he did, you’re probably better off forgetting him.”

‘You knew,’ Kenneth thought as he watched the shopkeeper retreat back inside. ‘You knew, and I hope YOU never forget. If you ever get another chance, you’d better stay true to your word and actually do something differently.’

They kept walking. “Did you know that guy very well?” Bryce asked.

Kenneth shook his head. “No. But, he knew Father. Everyone here knew Father. And… I look like him. I REALLY look like him. If my hair was black, I’d basically be his clone. People are going to recognize me.”

Bryce wanted to grab Kenneth’s hand, but even Dwight had let go of him now that they were more likely to be seen. He hoped Kenneth didn’t see his Father staring back at him whenever he looked in a mirror.

When they passed the bar Father had frequented— The place his parents had met— Kenneth picked up the pace. He half-expected Father to actually be inside the thing, logic and the rules of human mortality be damned.

A group of three men were on their way in, but one of them stopped abruptly and nudged his companions. “I think that’s—“

Another of the men called over, “Are you Francis’s son?”

Kenneth ignored them.

“Hey!” The man shouted. “Wait up—“

Kenneth made himself stop and turn to face the group. “What?” He demanded. He’d never met Father’s bar friends, but judging by how old these guys looked, he assumed that was who they were.

“I’m Steve,” one of the men said. “These are Wayne and Ralph. We used to—“

“You drank with my Father,” Kenneth finished.

“More like he drank next to us and we tried to pretend he wasn’t there,” Ralph said. “Or, we’d try to piss him off so he’d leave. No offense, but your dad was a dick once he had enough to drink.”

“He’s dead now, you know,” Kenneth wasn’t sure why he was informing them of that. There was no way they DIDN’T already know, and it wasn’t like he cared if they honored his memory or not.

“Yeah,” Wayne said. “We know. And… Uh…”

“We kinda always hoped we’d see you at the bar someday,” Steve said.

“I don’t drink,” Kenneth said. “And I left town right after my Father died.”

“Yeah, we kinda figured you were gone ‘cause we stopped seeing you,” Steve said. “But… Well, the only reason we wanted to see you is we… Sort of want to apologize.”

“What?”

“Gotta be honest,” Steve said. “We couldn’t stand your Father. He was always starting fights over stupid shit and ruining everyone’s fun. We came here to relax, he came here to be obnoxious. And, no one would ever say anything because he was going through a hard time after that thing with your Mom.”

“So,” Wayne said. “We kept trying to get him to screw off, by just messing with him. And, he’d leave us alone if we made him feel embarrassed, and… We sort of…”

“We… Saw you playing with your friend sometimes,” Ralph said. “And we saw that it made Francis uncomfortable that you were so close, so… We’d say stuff to him about it. We said things about you that were— Well, there’s no way around it, we were assholes. We were a lot younger then, but we were still assholes. And we’ve always felt bad about it.”

“Oh…” Kenneth said. “Father told me some of the stuff you said, it made him…”

“We’re sorry,” Steve promised. “We all really regret it, I’d take back everything I said if I could.”

Kenneth lowered his voice. Again, he wasn’t sure why he was doing this. He didn’t have to worry about Father punishing him for acknowledging their shared, ‘open secret’ anymore. “Did you know what Father was doing to me at home?”

“You looked kinda bashed up a lot of the time,” Ralph said. “Was that because of him?”

“Yes,” Kenneth said. “And… And every time he went out to drink, and you said stuff like that to him, he came home and he did it even worse than usual.”

The three men fell quiet.

“We… Didn’t mean for that to happen…” Steve said.

“Well, it did,” Kenneth said. “If… If you noticed I was being hurt, why didn’t you do anything?” He felt like he was going to cry all of the sudden. This question had been on his mind for most of his life, and now that he was finally in a position to get an answer, he couldn’t hold in his feelings.

None of the three responded, and an awkward silence gripped the group.

“Well…” Steve said. “Uh…”

“I thought maybe Francis was hurting you, but then I thought maybe you just fell or something,” Wayne offered. “I didn’t want to say anything, and then it turns out nothing was going on.”

“I was worried about what Francis would do,” Ralph said. “He was… Really awful whenever he came to the bar, if he got in trouble and he found out I was the one that said something…”

“I… I honestly…” Steve struggled. “I just… I thought someone else would do it…”

None of the answers were particularly satisfying, but they were still answers. Kenneth didn’t think there WERE any good answers to a question like this. “Well…” he said. “Sorry you had to put up with my Father.” He wasn’t really. At least they’d had the ability to just leave the bar whenever they wanted to. Kenneth had never had such a luxury.

“Sounds like your Dad didn’t have many friends,” Bryce said as they walked off.

“He didn’t deserve any,” Kenneth said, biting back against a hitch in his throat.

“Kenneth, are you okay?” Dwight asked.

“I’m… I’m fine… It’s just… Everyone’s suddenly SO sorry NOW,” Kenneth heaved out a heavy breath. “Now that it barely even MATTERS.”

“It does matter,” Dwight said gently. “I think, if these folks ever see anything like that happening again, they’ll try to fix it.”

They passed by the jailhouse. Kenneth tried his best not to look at IT, either. The police had spoken to Father ONE time regarding Kenneth, and the memory of that was one of the worst Kenneth had.

Finally, they had to turn onto a new street.

Dwight started to walk a little faster, but he didn’t know why. No matter how quickly they went past these homes, Kenneth still knew exactly where they were.

Besides, Kenneth had already frozen completely. He stood ramrod straight, staring at one of the buildings. His fingers twitched at his sides, and his face was paling. His expression didn’t convey any emotion at all, Dwight swore his eyes had suddenly dulled.

“Paulson,” Bryce said, noticing Kenneth dithering. “The church IS this way, righ—“

Dwight held a hand up. “Bryce, this is… This WAS Kenneth’s Father’s house.”

Bryce now looked more closely at the building that Kenneth was staring at so intently. It looked like a perfectly ordinary home, nothing sinister about it. It was almost hard to believe anything evil had ever taken place within it, but Bryce knew that it had.

The last time Kenneth had seen that house, he’d noticed how worn and lifeless the grass had become and how overgrown and unkempt all of the bushes were. Among the other houses on the street, the gloomy, run-down place had looked bizarre. The area around it had smelled awful, too. The steps that led up to the front door were all worn down so much that nothing remained apart from bare, moldy bits of wood. The walls had been coated in dark yellow and brown stains that were the result of Father’s constant smoking.

Today, the smell was gone. The bushes had been tended to. The steps had been replaced. The walls had been given a fresh coat of paint. But, in spite of all the polish, it still looked gloomy to him. It looked haunted. No matter how neat the bushes looked, how shiny the steps were, or how cleanly it was painted, it would always look like a prison. It just had an aura about it, one that iced Kenneth’s bones, as if the house itself was trying to tell him that he wasn’t welcome here.

Since the house was being taken care of, that meant someone new must have been living inside it. Kenneth tried to picture that; A normal family spending their days doing normal things, pacing through the rooms that had once been torture chambers, completely unaware of what this place used to be.

The hall closet, which had served as Kenneth’s ‘bedroom’, was probably now full of clothes. The owners not realizing that a child had once needed to cry himself to sleep there every night, trying to warm himself as he laid on the floor without the comfort of a blanket or pillow. The hallway where his Mother had been killed was walked through several times a day by people who had no idea they were stepping through the sight of a murder.

The new owners probably couldn’t feel the sinister aura of that building like Kenneth could. They didn’t know that this was an evil place, filled with the ghosts of screams. They couldn’t smell the odor of terror that Kenneth was sure had seeped into every crevice. They couldn’t—

“Hi-hi!” Said a small voice. “Are you a soldier?”

Kenneth jumped, startled. He looked down to see a little girl beside him. She was staring up at him with a wide smile. “Um—“

“Iris,” another, much deeper voice called from a little further down the road. “Don’t talk to strangers.”

“But, he’s a soldier, Daddy!” The little girl said. “That means he’s a good guy.”

Kenneth didn’t think he qualified as a ‘good guy’. His temper was too volatile for that. He yelled at people, he scared children…

Iris wasn’t scared of him, though.

Dwight crouched down a little and waved at her. “Hi there,” he said. “Yes, we’re all soldiers. But, your dad’s right, you shouldn’t talk to people you’ve never met before.”

“How’m I supposed to meet new people to talk to, then?” Iris asked. “If I never talk to anybody, then everyone’s a stranger.”

Her father caught up and took her hand. “Sorry about that,” he said.

“It’s fine,” Bryce assured.

Kenneth looked at the girl’s father. He didn’t recognize him at all, he must have been a new arrival. He wondered who would actually CHOOSE to move here. He glanced back at Father’s house. Even if it belonged to somebody else, it would always be Father’s house…

“Haven’t seen you guys around here,” the man said. “Nice to meet you, I’m Lucas. I doubt the military is sending you on a mission here, so are you moving in, or—“

“These two used to live here,” Bryce filled in, pointing to Kenneth and Dwight. “Back when they were kids. We’re trying to find this person they used to know. Do you know anyone named Ann?”

“Ann…?” Lucas repeated. “Nope, I’m afraid I’ve never met an Ann. But, we haven’t been here for that long, we just might not know her yet.” He smiled, continuing to exude a friendly air that felt completely out of place around Father’s house. “So, what part of town did you grow up in?”

Dwight shuffled uncomfortably. He didn’t like talking about how he’d been orphaned, how he didn’t actually KNOW where he’d come from. Sometimes, people treated him differently once they found that out.

Kenneth wasn’t eager to say where HE’D been brought up, either, but to save Dwight the trouble, he admitted it. “Um… Right here…” he said.

“This house?” Lucas’s smile widened. “Ah, I see why you were staring at it, then. Must bring back a lot of memories.”

Kenneth glanced away. It did, but they were all memories he wished he could erase.

“Mister soldier,” Iris said. “Did you ever find the secret room?”

Kenneth looked down at her. He shrugged, unsure what she was talking about.

“You didn’t?” Iris gathered. “It’s fun! It’s my clubhouse now! Daddy! I wanna show Mister Solider the secret room!” She grabbed Kenneth’s hand. “I’m gonna show you all my drawings!”

“Alright,” Lucas said. “You guys look kind of tired, you want to have lunch with us?”

“Uhhh…” Bryce glanced at Kenneth. He was so pale that he looked almost translucent. Even his lips had turned white.

Dwight was staring at his friend as well. He didn’t think he’d ever seen Kenneth shake that much before. “Well, we wouldn’t want to impose…”

“Nonsense,” Lucas said. “We don’t mind at all. Especially if one of you grew up right here!”

And that was how Kenneth found himself re-entering his childhood home for the first time since the day he’d ended his Father’s rancid life. The sound of the front door opening was just like any other front door, but it sent a shiver down his spine. When it was shut behind them a second later, Kenneth felt his heart drop down to his knees. He heard the bolt moving into place, trapping him here. Trapping him in Hell, forever.

It took a second for his foggy vision to clear enough for him to look around. He didn’t WANT to look around, but he did anyway. The interior had not changed as much as the exterior had. Same wallpaper, just patched over in a few places. He spotted light stains in the wooden flooring, likely imperceptible to the new occupants, but Kenneth knew the darker brown tinges were from where his blood had once dried and seeped into the floorboards. Against his will, a high pitched whimper bubbled in his throat.

“Hm?” Lucas asked.

“N—Nothing!” Kenneth squeaked. He tried not to look at the hall-closet, now most likely full of shoes and coats and NORMAL closet things. In the past, that had been his ‘bedroom’.

They reached the living room, and Kenneth started to shake even harder.

“Sue’s getting lunch ready,” Lucas gestured towards the kitchen. “So, I’ll give you guys a tour— I guess one of you doesn’t really need that, but—“

“I wanna show him my clubhouse!” Iris whined.

“Okay, okay…” Lucas said. “Go show him, then.”

Iris took Kenneth’s wrist and started to drag him off.

***

Dwight had never actually BEEN in Kenneth’s old home before. He’d visited it only once, and had just gotten a quick glimpse at the front hallway after he’d knocked on the door. Kenneth’s Father had answered, and Dwight asked if Kenneth could come out to play.

Kenneth’s Father had just frowned and stated “Kenneth doesn’t have any friends,” before slamming the door in Dwight’s face.

Now, the house looked pretty normal. It was hard to imagine what had once taken place inside it, but then Dwight started to notice little details, there were odd stains in the lower parts of the wallpaper, some scuff marks and indents in the floor that hadn’t been repaired. Signs that something violent had happened in here once before.

Bryce didn’t notice any of those things, but he felt that the house had a weird atmosphere. He doubted he would have noticed it if he hadn’t already heard the stories from Kenneth, but the rooms all felt colder than he’d expected them to.

***

When Iris started to lead him through Father’s old study Kenneth realized he DID know what the ‘secret room’ was. In the back of Father’s old study, there was a false bookcase that was actually a door. He should have KNOWN that was the ‘secret room’, because in a NORMAL house, that’s what it WOULD have been.

But, when this had been Father’s house, that room had just been another of Kenneth’s prison cells, Father’s go-to once he was too big for the box. The room was very small, and when Kenneth had been little, it had contained nothing but a lightbulb hanging from the ceiling and a pole that stretched from the floor to the ceiling. Father had gotten a leash meant for dogs, and he’d wrap one end of it around the pole, then put the other around Kenneth’s ankle, so that when he was locked in there he didn’t even have the luxury of being able to move around the entire cell.

Kenneth had almost died in that room, Father leaving him there without water for so long that he’d actually started to hallucinate, hearing and seeing things that weren’t there.

If he had his way, that room would be pumped full of concrete and sealed off forever.

It wasn’t supposed to be anyone’s ‘clubhouse’.

Iris reached for the fake-book case and swung it open “Ta-da!” She cried, gesturing proudly to what had once been Kenneth’s personal Hell.

Kenneth stayed where he was.

“Come on!” Iris said, reaching for his hand again and tugging him forwards. He had to fight NOT to struggle, not to freak out, to instead pretend like everything was fine, and he didn’t mind playing inside a torture chamber with this kid. Like, this room WASN’T a torture chamber, because he knew that it wasn’t one to her. She’d be scared if she knew what the room actually was. She’d be terrified, and it would be his fault.

Inside, the room had changed a little. There was still a lightbulb swinging from the ceiling, and the pole was still there. But, the pole had been covered in stickers, and the wall was decorated with tons of Iris’s crayon drawings.

“Secret room!” Iris proclaimed proudly. She shut the door and Kenneth’s breathing immediately went into rapid-fire mode, his chest heaving and his vision blurring as he huffed through his mouth and nose.

“Huh…?” Iris asked. “Mister Soldier, do you have… Do you have Asthma, like Daddy?”

“N—No,” Kenneth said, reaching for the door. “Can we… Please, just keep the door open, okay? I need… I just really need it to be open.”

Iris shrugged, “Well… Okay!” She grabbed onto the pole and started to wriggle her way up it. “I’m gonna pretend I’m a fireman! Did you ever do that— Oh, right, you never found this room…”

“I… I did find it,” Kenneth confessed. “But, I didn’t ever play here. This used to be my Father’s study. I… Uh… I wasn’t supposed to play in it.”

“Aw,” Iris frowned, sliding back down. “Do you like my pictures?”

Kenneth looked them over. Seeing the walls plastered over with something new kind of helped him forget where he was, but then he noticed the little scratches in the floorboards that he’d made when he’d gotten delirious and thought that he could somehow dig his way to freedom. He wondered if Iris had ever noticed them.

“You’re not looking!” Iris pouted. “What’s on the floor,” she knelt down beside him and stared. “Oh, there’s claw marks… Did your family have a puppy when you lived here? I want a puppy, but Daddy won’t let me.”

Kenneth shook his head, continuing to stare. Gently, he laid his hand against the marks, curling his nails and trying to fit them directly into the minuscule scuffs he’d made so long ago.

“Let’s pretend we’re puppies!” Iris decided, getting onto all fours and rubbing her fingertips against the ground, like a dog asking to be let out.

Like… Like Kenneth begging for—

“STOP!” Kenneth blurted out.

Iris did, but she frowned. “What’s the matter?”

“Sorry, sorry…” Kenneth said, sitting up more. “I’m— I just— I’m sorry, I— Uh— I can’t— I can’t be in here, I’m sorry.” He stood and walked out of the room, but now he was in Father’s study, where the man had stayed up drinking so many nights, sometimes screaming for Kenneth to come in just so he could beat him for whatever nonsensical reason he’d been able to conjure.

Iris followed him. “Mister Soldier, are you scared of something?”

“Huh?” He turned and looked down at her. “No, I— I just… I’m thirsty. REALLY thirsty.” That wasn’t a lie, being in that room… Remembering the FOUR days he’d been made to go without a drink in there, how he’d nearly died… His throat hurt, it burned. He needed water, he needed it now, he was going to die—

“Okay,” Iris said.

He followed her dully into the kitchen. With shaking hands, he grabbed a glass and began to fill it with water from the sink. He spilled some of it trying to get it into his mouth, and had swallowed the rest in under a minute. He quickly re-filled the glass and did the same thing again. Repeat.

“You ARE thirsty,” Iris said. “Is it ‘cause they make you do those marches so much?”

“Y—Yeah,” Kenneth said, once he was at last able to pull himself away from the sink. “That’s… That’s it…” His shakes were dying down, but he was still— He was still fucking HERE, and he needed to be ANYWHERE else.

Dwight came to his side and, without thinking, he immediately leaned into him, hugging him tightly.

Dwight didn’t push him away, even though Iris was still there. She was too young to think anything of it, he hoped. He just rubbed Kenneth’s back and whispered to him, “It’s okay. I’m here… And HE’S not… Nothing can hurt you, it’s just a building…”

“Are you married?” Iris blurted.

Dwight and Kenneth backed away from each other. “What?” Dwight asked.

“Mommy and Daddy hug like that because they’re married. So, are you married?”

Dwight shook his head, forcing a laugh. “No, we’re just friends,” he said. “Me and Kenneth, and the other soldier Bryce, we’re all friends.”

“Oh,” Iris said. “Okay. Wanna see my bedroom?”

“Uh—“

A woman, most likely Lucas’s wife Sue, poked her head into the kitchen and informed them that lunch was ready in the dining room.

Kenneth followed Iris that way, and his eyes immediately became fixated on part of the dining room’s wall. Lucas was beside it, talking to Bryce, gesturing to the gash. The gash that was STILL there, from the time Father had thrown him so hard into the wall that he’d damaged it. Father had been so furious with him for that, and had started to kick him around on the floor, screaming, shouting, calling him every awful name he could think of.

And it was STILL there, just as obvious as the day it had been made—

“I’ve been wanting to patch this part up,” Lucas was saying. “Not sure how to do it, or what happened h—“ He turned. “Oh, Kenneth, do you remember what happened to this bit of the wall?”

“Wha— I—“ Kenneth stammered. “I don’t— I don’t kn— I— I have to— I need to lea— I really have to go to the bathroom, sorry. I’ll be right back!” He hurried from the room, down the hall and into the restroom. When he shakily latched the door’s lock into place, he was met with the unfortunate realization that his excuse to leave hadn’t been much of an excuse. He actually DID really need to use the bathroom. Suddenly, he felt like he was going to pee his pants if he didn’t have his zipper down in the next three seconds.

His hands flew to his crotch for a tight squeeze and he hobbled in front of the toilet, the same one Father had always— Had always stood behind him at while he tried to use, screaming at him, pulling his hair, all before beating him for his failure to conjure up the stream he needed so badly to let loose.

He unzipped his pants and aimed. His bladder convulsed sharply, and— And for some reason he felt more desperate to piss than he could ever recall feeling in his life. He felt like he was being stretched wide open, his skin tearing as his bladder ripped through it. He felt like piss was going to start gushing out his ears, flowing from his nostrils, streaming from his eyes, pushing itself through every opening it could find in him.

But, it DIDN’T gush out through the one hole it actually COULD move through. It wouldn’t come out at all, and he— It HURT, he needed to go so badly that it HURT, and he wanted to cry, he wanted to scream, he wanted to beg, just BEG—

“WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU?!” He heard Father’s voice. He physically HEARD his voice, just as clearly as if the man was actually THERE beside him. “Stop whining to me about needing to piss when you OBVIOUSLY don’t have to go!”

‘I do,’ Kenneth thought, shuddering miserably as his opening burned. ‘Please, I can’t take it…’

He couldn’t go. Everything hurt so bad. His bladder was spasming out of control, his length ached, his urethra felt like it had been rubbed with salt and lemon juice. His lungs were collapsing, his head throbbed, his vision blurred, and the wallpaper in front of him was the very same pattern he’d stared at every time Father had screamed at him to piss.

Kenneth could hear Father counting down now. “If you don’t start pissing in the next five seconds, I’m going to make sure you can’t sit down for the next month! Five… Four…”

Kenneth ticked off the final three seconds in his head, then forced himself to tuck his dick back into his pants and zip them. He still needed to pee unfathomably badly, the walls of his bladder seeming to contract and squeeze in. The sudden urge that had slammed into him just minutes before already felt like it was going to turn into an accident But, he knew that if he tried to use the toilet again, the same thing would happen. He’d just hold it, like always. He didn’t have a choice.

He left the restroom on stiff, shaking legs, trying very hard to strain his thighs in such a way that his opening remained pinched closed between them. His need wasn’t quite as agonizing now that he’d left the bathroom, but it was still very prominent and annoying. He found everyone still in the dining room, eating. Iris was talking to Dwight now, but when she saw Kenneth she waved to him.

Kenneth just sat down beside Dwight and didn’t move, apart from using the cover the table provided to hold his crotch. His heart just wouldn’t settle down, and now he was worried about where he WOULD go to pee once he finally got out of here. Obviously, he couldn’t relieve himself in this house, he needed to be somewhere that he actually felt comfortable. Did such a place even exist in this town?

The orphanage…

Yeah, the only time he’d ever felt safe as a child was when he was with Dwight. So, the orphanage where Dwight had lived had been safe too. They had to go THERE as soon as possible…

“Mister Soldier?” Iris said, and Kenneth tried to make himself listen to her. He didn’t mean to ignore her, everything was just… Too much.

“I finished eating, can you play with me more?”

Kenneth didn’t want to… He didn’t want to let her drag him through more awful rooms in this awful house.

“I wanna show you my room,” Iris said. “It used to be yours, right?”

Kenneth said nothing, just stood and followed after her.

Iris’s room HAD once been Kenneth’s, up until the death of his Mother, anyway. After that, Father took it away, he had Kenneth sleep underneath the dining room table instead. But, that only lasted about a month, then Father decided Kenneth was unworthy of sleeping somewhere Father would have to SEE him, so he was banished to the hall closet. Father had left this bedroom empty, he mainly used it as just another place to beat Kenneth in, taking advantage of all the vacant space to freely bash him around.

It was weird to see actual furniture in here.

“Are you cold?” Iris asked. “Why are you shaking?”

Kenneth didn’t know if his shivers were from how raw his emotions were, or from how awful his need to pee was. He noticed he’d crossed his legs, but didn’t bother untangling them. He needed to allow SOMETHING to give himself a bit of comfort.

Iris sat down at a small, child-sized desk, starting to color. “Do you want to draw with me?”

Kenneth shrugged.

“You’re quiet,” Iris remarked. “Are you shy?”

Another shrug. Kenneth supposed he was kind of shy. One part of his body sure was, anyway. And it was adding to his current misery. He made himself crouch down beside Iris and immediately regretted it when his bladder sent a sharp, painfully hot twinge through him. His brow creasing and his eyes squeezing closed, he was unable to stop his hands from going to his crotch.

“You have to go pee again…?”

“It’s— It’s noth— Nothing,” Kenneth insisted. “I just— I’m going to have to leave soon, I—“

“Is it ‘cause of me?”

“No,” Kenneth said. “It’s— It’s… It’s just this house, okay?” He knew she wouldn’t understand it, but he couldn’t think through anything he was saying anymore. His brain felt mushy, overwhelmed by caustic emotions and a brutal need to relieve himself.

Iris suddenly looked frightened. “Is it haunted?” She asked. “I told Daddy I heard noises in the hallway at night, and he wouldn’t believe me! You have to tell him!”

Kenneth shook his head. This house absolutely WAS haunted to him, but not in the way she was thinking. “It’s not… There aren’t any ghosts, don’t worry. Just… A long time ago… A… A very bad man lived here.” He didn’t know what he was doing, he shouldn’t be talking about this to her— To any member of her family. They didn’t need to know they were living in the lair of a monster.

“Was he evil? Like, a wicked witch?”

“He— He was evil,” Kenneth said. He wriggled, trying to sit more comfortably on the floor. He’d gotten his hands out from between his thighs, but now he had to lean backwards to give his bladder some room, legs crossed in front of him. “A male witch is called a warlock, and… Yeah, a warlock used to live here.”

Iris looked more frightened. “Does he still—“

“No,” Kenneth said. “He’s gone now. But, um… The warlock had a prisoner. And he put lots of curses on his prisoner, so that even though he’s gone now, his prisoner still can’t be free.”

“That’s sad…” Iris said. “Is the prisoner still here?”

Kenneth paused. “K—Kind of…” He looked around. “He left, but… But, sometimes it feels like he never did.”

“I wanna hear the story,” Iris told him.

Kenneth didn’t meet her gaze, he instead glanced down at his own body, all the knots it was tied into. He’d grabbed at himself again, and now he couldn’t let go. But, talking was taking his mind off of the horrid ache in his bladder, and helping his heart-rate calm down a little too.

“O—Okay… Well, at the beginning of the story… There was… Um… There was a princess. She was the nicest princess to ever live, she cared about ev—everyone and only ever wanted to do the right thing. The princess’s best friend was… Er, a servant girl. They did everything together. But, the princess’s mom was a really evil queen with nothing but ice in her heart. The queen didn’t want the princess and the servant to be friends, so she forbid them from talking and sent the princess to the warlock.

“The warlock… Um… He… Uh…. He gave the princess a potion, and the potion made her have a baby. And, because she had a baby, the queen decided she needed to stay with the warlock forever. The princess loved her baby, and that made the warlock angry, because he hated babies. He eventually… Locked the princess in a dungeon, so that she and the baby couldn’t see each other anymore. The baby became the warlock’s prisoner.

“The warlock cast a bunch of spells on his prisoner. The spells hurt a lot, but there was nothing the prisoner could do to make it stop. He cried a lot, but no one ever came. Until… Until, one day, a brave knight heard the prisoner crying and tried to free him. But, the knight couldn’t do it. The prisoner had to help. So, the prisoner took… uh… He took the warlock’s magic wand, and zapped him away. But, even after that, none of the spells he’d put on his prisoner were broken.

“The prisoner went to go live with the knight, and the knight keeps trying to break all of the spells. But, it’s really hard because the knight doesn’t know any magic, so the curses are always kind of there… The knight makes the prisoner very happy, though, and they can have lots of fun together even though one of them still hurts sometimes.”

“What about the princess?” Iris asked. “Is she still in the dungeon?”

Kenneth hesitated. “I… I think so…” he said. “Um… Before she got locked up, she wrote a spell of her own that would set her free. But, only the servant girl that had been her friend can cast it, and no one knows where the servant went, so she needs to be found before the princess can be free.”

“Oh…” Iris said. “I thought fairy tales were supposed to have happy endings?”

“This one doesn’t…”

“Were you the prisoner?”

“I think I still am,” Kenneth said. He sat up more, flinching as his bladder churned and reminded him of its fullness. “Like, you can tell I have to go to the bathroom really bad?”

Iris giggled, and Kenneth tried not to blush.

“Well, I can’t because of one of the spells from the warlock,” Kenneth explained. “Sometimes the knight can break that spell, but I have to be in the right place, or it doesn’t work. And… You see how much I’m shaking? That’s because, this is where all the spells were cast, so they’re more powerful here than anywhere else. I can feel myself being hurt again, even though the warlock is gone.”

“So, my house is scary for you?”

“Yeah,” Kenneth admitted. “Lots of bad things happened in it. I don’t have many good memories here.”

“You have some, though?”

“Yeah, I guess…” Kenneth said.

“What’s one?”

“There used to be a piano,” Kenneth explained. “My Mother— The princess in the story, she was really good at playing it. I liked to sit on her lap while she did that. That was nice.” He fidgeted, crossing his legs around in the other direction.

“Does the curse mean you can’t go into the bathroom here?”

Kenneth shook his head. “No, the curse is… It’s hard to explain. When people who aren’t cursed go to pee, they get to the toilet and it just… Happens, right? But, because of the curse, I have to try really hard. It doesn’t come out.”

“Does it hurt?”

Kenneth nodded. “Sometimes… It’s one of the ones that still hurts the most. The knight should be able to help me break it again today if we go to the place where he grew up.”

“Which one of your soldier friends is the knight?”

“Dwight— The one with the dark red hair. Bryce, the other one, kind of is too, I guess. They should be finished eating soon, so I’ll be okay.”

“You’re leaving soon?” Iris gathered, frowning. “Will you come back?”

Kenneth doubted it. He had no intention of ever returning to this town once his task was complete, especially not to this house. “We’ll see… But, could you make me a promise?”

“What?”

“Well… A couple promises, actually,” Kenneth said. “First, I want you to keep decorating your clubhouse, alright? I want you to put up lots more stickers and drawings, and anything else you can think of to make it look nice. Can you keep doing that, even when you start getting older?”

“Okay.”

“Also… Um…” Kenneth felt like he was going to cry again, and tried to stop himself from doing so. “I think the house is sad because of all the bad things the warlock did inside it. Pretty much all it has are painful memories. Do you think you and your family can make lots of new, happy memories here?”

“Yeah,” Iris said. “We have fun here.”

“Good,” Kenneth nodded.

A few minutes later, Dwight and Bryce appeared in the doorway. “Kenneth…” Dwight said gently. “Ready to go?”

Kenneth sprang up like a rubber-band and hurried to Dwight’s side. The sudden movement really annoyed his bladder, waking it back up and causing a surge of heat to begin working its way down his length. He tensed his thighs and prevented the leak from ebbing out, but he really had to get to a usable toilet soon. “Yes!” He said.

“Alright…” Dwight said. “Come on…” He worked to get Kenneth out the front door as quickly as he could, allowing Bryce to handle all the ‘goodbyes’ to Iris and her parents.

Once outside, and after a few more paces down the street, Kenneth blurted out “I want to relieve myself soon, okay?”

Dwight nibbled his lip. He’d been worried that Kenneth’s earlier exclamation about ‘really needing the bathroom’ hadn’t just been an excuse. “Uhhh… Okay…” he said, turning around a few times, trying to think of ANY place where Kenneth might be able to go.

“Think you can do it at the church when we get there?” Bryce asked.

Kenneth shook his head, “I—It will be easiest if we go to the orphanage…” he admitted. “I felt comfortable there when I was little.”

“That’s where we’ll go then,” Bryce said.

The orphanage wasn’t far away. Kenneth could recall hurriedly running there many times as a child, desperate to be beside the one person that could make him feel safe. On a good day, it only took him ten minutes to get from his house to the orphanage.

On a bad day, where something was impeding his ability to walk, it could take longer. That could be anything from an injury, to exhaustion, to the need to relieve himself, like now. The heaviness of his bladder was slowing him down quite a bit. His toes pointed inwards, and his knees shook. He had to take very careful, very slow little steps.

“Hey,” Dwight said. “A few times when we were little, if it was an emergency, I’d keep watch for you while you went behind a building, is that—“

Kenneth shook his head, “N—Not… It won’t work now.”

He sounded so certain of it that Dwight didn’t press. Kenneth was in such a fragile state that he was worried if being back at a ‘safe’ place would even do him much good.

They made it to the orphanage, and Dwight awkwardly knocked on the door. He realized now that it would look odd for them all to show up here unannounced just to pee. Of course, he had intended to ask them about Ann too, but from all the squirming Kenneth was doing, it was obvious which would have to happen first.

The door was opened a moment later. Thankfully, Dwight recognized the woman on the other side, Sister Isabelle was one of the nuns who’d been present when he was a child. She recognized him as well, “Dwight,” she said, smiling. “Nice to see you back in town— And you’ve brought friends. What brings you here?”

Dwight stepped inside first. Like Kenneth, he was hit by a flood of memories as soon as he’d entered his childhood dwelling. But, unlike Kenneth, a great many of them were actually pleasant. Yes, he’d been picked on a lot for being small, and he’d often suffered hunger from the poor food supply, but he’d never felt unsafe here. Just very lonely. And that had changed after he’d met Kenneth.

Even just being in the entryway, Dwight could recall lots of things he’d done with Kenneth here. He remembered racing around the place with him, he remembered playing tic-tac-toe with him on the floor, he remembered drawing with him. Mostly, he remembered just talking to Kenneth, sometimes late into the night, like they still did today.

He hoped Kenneth remembered those things now, too.

“Kenneth, is that you?” Isabelle asked.

“Y—Yeah,” Kenneth nodded, trying not to fidget under her gaze. He was too embarrassed to immediately ask her for the toilet. It would be rude to do that anyway. Etiquette dictated that he wait until he was offered use of the restroom.

She was looking all over his body now, making him sweat. Part of him wanted to start crossing his legs again, to make it obvious that he needed to go so that she’d ask. But, the rest was far too humiliated by the idea of making his situation so blatant. He resorted to just pushing his knees and thighs together as hard as he could.

“… You look well,” Isabelle said finally, and there was a slackness to her facial features that hadn’t been there before. “How have you been? I want you to—“

“He needs to use the restroom,” Dwight interrupted. “That’s part of why we’re h—“

“Dwight…” Kenneth whined, reddening.

“Oh, of course you may go,” Isabelle said. “The children are all playing out back, so it should be empty.”   Dwight relaxed a bit. The bathroom being occupied or, worse, blocked by one of the horrendous lines he could recall from childhood, was one of the things he’d been worried about.

Kenneth remembered exactly where the toilet was here and, upon locking the door to the room, his bladder was already spasming and attempting to loosen itself. He had to grab his crotch to stem an approaching leak. His body was behaving exactly how it did when he got back to his restroom at the end of a long day, it recognized he was somewhere safe and was trying to get ahead of him, not giving him the time to unzip before it emptied.

Kenneth lost a couple little dribbles before he could aim at the toilet, but once he was in the right spot everything happened automatically. He didn’t have to fight and try to get himself to pee, his bladder was cooperating— Just like it always had when he was a kid and standing in this spot.

When he was a kid, Dwight was always on the other side of the door, reassuring him that he was the ONLY one there, and that he wouldn’t be in trouble for peeing. Kenneth would feel okay, he’d feel comfortable. No one was screaming at him, no one was pulling his hair. He knew that, once he left this room, no new tortures would await him outside. He’d just get to stay with his friend for as long as he could.

He’d be calm, relaxed. And he wouldn’t hate himself. He wouldn’t feel like anything was horribly wrong with him.

He had all the same feelings now, warmth, safety and security.

Kenneth finished peeing and went back down the stairs, Dwight and Bryce were still there with Isabelle.

“We wanted to wait for you to get back before we asked,” Bryce said. “In case you wanted to be the one to do it.”

“Alright…” Kenneth said. Hopeful, he turned to Isabelle. “I’m trying to find a friend of my Mother’s. I can’t really remember what she looked like, I think she had brown hair, but that’s it. Her name was Ann. Do you know her?”

Isabelle thought for a second, then shook her head. “I’m sorry…”

“It’s okay,” Kenneth said, he turned away. “Dwight, if you want to catch up with her for a minute, we don’t have to leave right away.”

“Hang on,” Isabelle said. “Kenneth… I want you to know something.”

Kenneth looked back at her, “Hm?”

“It’s… When you came over to play with Dwight… We noticed. Not right away, but when every day you always had a new bruise, or Dwight would tell us something unusual about your home-life, or one of us would see your Father behaving strangely in public… We knew something was wrong.”

Dwight could remember telling the nuns about Kenneth. At that time, he was so young that he didn’t realize that what he was saying would set off alarm-bells in any reasonable adult. He’d just been repeating things Kenneth had said to him, things that he thought were weird or confusing. “My friend Kenneth’s only allowed to drink water if his Dad says so.” “Kenneth said his Dad kicked him out for tonight even though it’s raining so much. Can he stay here just this once?” “Kenneth sleeps in a closet, even though there’s an empty bedroom! Isn’t that strange? None of the kids here sleep in closets, and it’s way more crowded here!” “Kenneth isn’t supposed to go pee without permission. We don’t have rules like that here, right? He wants to make sure so that he doesn’t get in trouble.”

“We noticed,” Sister Isabelle repeated. “All of us, it broke our hearts to see you so hurt and frightened of everything. No child should be as timid as you were… I want you to know that we saw, and that we tried to help.”

Kenneth nodded. The nuns had helped in little ways. Whenever he visited, they’d offer him hugs, water, warm blankets… If he had any bad injuries, they’d assist him with bandaging them up. They had done things to help, but Kenneth had always needed to go back to Father in the end. The nuns couldn’t prevent that from—

“Kenneth, do you remember a police officer ever going to your house to speak to your Father?”

Kenneth DID remember that, it had been one of the worst days of his life. It had started with Father ordering him to put on an expensive looking, fancy sweater before dragging him to the front hall.

There, he’d seen a police officer, and he’d felt so relieved. The police were there to help people and get rid of bad guys. Kenneth needed help, and his Father was a REALLY bad guy. That meant the officer was going to take Father away and make it so that he could never hurt Kenneth ever again.

But, that wasn’t what happened.

Instead, Father talked the officer. Father had described how he’d been ‘heartbroken’ over the sudden loss of his wife— taken from him by an armed ‘burglar’— that he’d allowed his drinking to get out of hand. He’d said that, thanks to his alcoholism and depression, he hadn’t been giving Kenneth the ‘attention’ he needed, which was why Kenneth had felt the need to concoct a wild story about being mistreated in order to garner attention from others.

Kenneth had been really disturbed by the ease with which Father lied to the officer, and even more so by the way the officer seemed to be believing every word of it! Eventually, the officer said he needed a minute to talk to Kenneth alone, so Father had reluctantly left.

Right away, Kenneth started to plead with the officer to listen to him, that Father was lying, that Father did horrible things to him, that he was scared Father might kill him. He’d rolled up the too-long sleeves of the sweater, he’d shown all the deep bruises and cuts that littered his arms.

But, the officer didn’t listen to any of it. He pointed out that Kenneth’s sweater was very expensive, and probably worth more than all of his own daughter’s clothing put together. He told Kenneth that he sounded like a spoiled brat, that he could tell Father was doing the best he could to care for him, and the least he could do is stop making up stories.

That was one of the first times Kenneth had felt that snap of rage light up his chest. It horrified him and pained him, and he’d started to cry hot, angry tears. “No, it’s not like that! He locks me up in a—“

“Sounds like you’re grounded.”

“No, you have to understand, he’s made me—“

“Yeah, I make my daughter do chores too,” the officer interrupted.

He’d refused to let Kenneth speak, to let Kenneth finish explaining that Father liked to lock him up in a tiny box that he barely fit into, or chain him to a pole, or that Father sometimes forced him to drink salt-water. The officer had already taken Father’s side, he wouldn’t even HEAR anything to the contrary. He didn’t care what Kenneth had to say. What Kenneth had to say didn’t matter. The truth didn’t matter.

Father came back shortly after.

“Sorry to trouble you,” the officer told him. “It’s as I thought.”

They’d continued to talk for a few more minutes as Kenneth stood in stunned, angry terror, tears rolling down his face. He couldn’t understand what was happening, and began to question if what Father was doing to him was actually normal, if he actually deserved all of it…

By the time Father was escorting the officer out the door, they were both laughing. But, the second the officer was gone, Father’s mirth vanished. He spun around to glare at Kenneth before declaring, in a spitting, hissing fury; “Now, you’re going to learn what ‘abuse’ actually is.”

What followed was the worst beating Kenneth would ever receive. By the end of it, he’d lost three teeth, could barely see out of his swollen eyes, and was in so much pain that he couldn’t even find the strength to crawl away.

“I do remember,” Kenneth told Isabelle now. “It… My Father was really mad.”

Isabelle frowned, “I’m sure he was… We were devastated when we learned the police had ‘looked into it’ and ‘found no cause for concern’. We didn’t know what else to do then…”

“It was you who sent the police?” Kenneth asked.

“One of us, yes,” Isabelle said. “It wasn’t me. It was Sister Beth. She was the most shaken up when the police failed to rescue you. I’d never seen anyone cry that hard before in my life. You meant a lot to her, I think because you helped Dwight come out of his shell a little. That’s why I don’t want you to leave yet. Sister Beth is out at the moment, and I want her to see you.”

Kenneth hesitated. He didn’t want to spend TOO much time here if it wasn’t going to get him closer to finding Ann. But, going to the police was the most ANY adult had ever done to help him as a child, even if it hadn’t worked. The fact that someone had TRIED, had cared enough TO try, made him want to see her.

He tried to remember which one Sister Beth was. He thought she was probably the one who’d given him a special quilt one year for Christmas. He had left it here at the orphanage, since he knew Father would take it from him if he left it at home. But, any time he got to sleep over with Dwight, he’d be able to warm himself with the quilt.

He still had it in the barrack with him now.

“It makes sense Beth would be the one to do that,” Dwight said. “She was the one who kind of liked to take-charge.”

“You remember her?” Bryce asked.

“Of course I do,” Dwight said. “I remember all of them, they were the closest thing I had to parents.”

Bryce shrugged, “I guess I just have trouble telling them apart, since they’re all dressed the same and all…”

“WE’RE all dressed the same, too,” Dwight pointed out.

“Oh, yeah…”

“I think I kind of remember her, too,” Kenneth said. “I just wasn’t as close to any of them as Dwight was.”

It took some time for Sister Beth to arrive. Kenneth started to grow a bit antsy. He knew it had been a bit of wishful thinking to hope he’d find Ann today— To hope he’d find her at ALL— But, he really didn’t want to stand around here and NOT keep looking for her.

He still needed to see Beth, though. Apart from Mother, Beth was the only one who’d ever REALLY tried to stop his Father. Even if it hadn’t worked, the fact that someone had TRIED meant the world to him.

The kids started to come inside eventually. Kenneth awkwardly tried to stand out of their ways. He knew they probably had adult visitors all the time, people looking to adopt one of the children, and he didn’t want any of them to get their hopes up.

Dwight watched the kids run in and scamper around the main floor. They were wearing the same sorts of clothes he’d had as a kid— Which had looked old-fashioned even then. He assumed the kids today had received the very same garments Dwight and the boys he’d grown up with had worn.

He felt weird seeing this new generation of parentless children. There were fewer in this bunch than there had been in the one he’d been part of. When Dwight was very young, there had been a terrible fever that ravaged this entire region of the country, and a harsh storm that destroyed the crops and caused many people to lose their livelihoods. Lots of kids those days lost both of their parents to the disease. Or, like Dwight, were given up as babies because their parents didn’t have the means to care for them.

There hadn’t been a sickness or a storm like that in a very long time, so not as many kids had lost their parents.

These kids all appeared happy, but Dwight knew that, like him, some of them probably stayed up at night wondering who their parents had even been. Others cried for the families that had been taken from them. And they all hoped to join a new family someday.

When Dwight was small, that had been his biggest dream; That a nice couple would adopt him and he’d have a family. It had never come true. Other boys were picked and taken home, but Dwight wasn’t one of them. He was never sure what it was that made him less appealing than the others, he worried that he may have been ugly, or that his voice was annoying.

His desire for adoption started to wane after he’d met Kenneth. He actually dreaded the idea that someone would bring him home, because what if they took him somewhere really far away from Kenneth?

Dwight hadn’t wanted to leave his family.

As he watched the kids play, an odd thought occurred to him; He could give one of THESE children a home, be the father he’d never had. He quickly dismissed the idea. The law was that only married couples could adopt, and Dwight didn’t want to be with anyone but Kenneth.

They would never be able to marry. The very notion of it was preposterous.

The door opened again, and a woman stepped inside. Dwight recognized her and waved, “Sister Beth,” he said. “Do you remember me?”

“Dwight?” Beth asked.

Dwight nodded, “Yeah. Kenneth and I are back in town for a while,” he gestured. “And this is our friend, Bryce. He came with us.”

“Hi,” Bryce said.

“We are trying to find someone who was important to my Mother,” Kenneth explained. “But, Sister Isabelle told me that, when I was little, you… Uh… You tried… To…”

“Let’s go upstairs,” Beth suggested.

Kenneth followed her there. It was a bit quieter, and Kenneth felt less like he was being put on the spot without any eyes on them. “Sister Isabelle says you were the one who tried to get the police to stop my Father, is that right?”

“Yes,” Beth confirmed. “I’m so sorry that it didn’t work.”

“It’s— It’s not your fault,” Kenneth assured. “I’m just glad someone TRIED. Thank you.”

An awkward silence hovered over them then. Kenneth had an urge to wave goodbye and leave, to continue his search, but he… Wasn’t ready to leave the side of the one adult who’d tried so keep him safe as a kid.

The one adult other than his Mother, anyway.

“So, you’re here because of Ramona, you said?”

Kenneth perked up at the sound of his Mother’s name. “You knew my Mother?”

“Yes,” Sister Beth nodded. “I did know her once.”

“Were you friends?”

“Yes. Your Mother was an amazing person. She could hear a song once, and immediately be able to play it the next time she was sat in front of a piano. It was stunning. The first time I talked to her… She was very soft-spoken, she seemed afraid of her own voice. It was like her music was the only sound she could allow herself to make. But, we became… Friends. Very good friends. When I found out she had—“ Beth sucked in a breath, like it still pained her to this day. Kenneth knew the feeling… “When I found out she’d passed on, I’d felt like a piece of me had gone with her. I so wanted to attend her funeral, but her mother wouldn’t allow it.”

Kenneth nodded solemnly. There had barely been ANY guests at Mother’s funeral. Just him, Father and her Mother. Kenneth had been the only one there to cry, and THAT had made him sob harder. It hurt to see that Father didn’t shed any tears for her. After what he’d done, he couldn’t even be bothered to mourn her.

That was also the first and only time he ever saw his Grandma, his Mother’s Mother. He didn’t say a word to her, and she didn’t say a word to him. She’d only granted him the briefest of acknowledgements while speaking to his Father; “So, THIS is the ‘mistake’, I see?”

Kenneth hadn’t WANTED to speak to her, anyway. Her attitude was callous and cold, and something about her seemed just… Off. Kenneth wasn’t sure what, she just gave him a bad feeling, a twisting in his gut. When she failed to show any emotion at her own daughter’s funeral, Kenneth knew he was right not to trust her.

“I wish you had come,” Kenneth told Beth. Mother deserved to have had more people who actually CARED by her side as she was laid to rest.

“Kenneth… “ Beth trailed off, her mouth twisting. “I… Could you please tell me one thing?”

“Hm?”

“I don’t want to upset you, I just… I need to know. It’s been eating me up for close to twenty years now. That story your Father told about the burglar, it’s never… Well, it’s never sat right with me. It’s never—“

“It wasn’t true,” Kenneth said. “He made it all up. There was no burglar, he didn’t try to save her, he… Did it.”

Tears gleamed in Beth’s eyes. “I… I had a feeling.” She wiped at her cheeks. “I’m sorry…”

Kenneth was tearing up too. “It’s okay… I still cry about it sometimes. I keep thinking about ways I could have saved her. If I’d gotten the gun away from Father, but I’d just been so scared that I couldn’t even move—“

“Oh, no— Did this happen with you watching?” Beth’s voice hitched.

“Yes…”

“Kenneth… No child should EVER…” Beth bit down on a sob. “I’ve always wished I could go back in time. I keep thinking there must have been some way I could have convinced Ramona not to… Not to marry that man. I knew she was being forced into it, the whole town knew, and they knew why. But, I knew just how bad of an idea it was. I was just… Stupid, I didn’t— I should have—“

“Her Mother was making her…” Kenneth said. “Don’t blame yourse—“

“I should have tried…” Beth said. “Ramona needed someone to stand up for her then, to take care of her. That should have been me, I was just… I was so angry at her at that time that I…”

“You’d had an argument?”

“No… It was a little more than that,” Beth said. “I— I wasn’t going to mention this, but I think you might understand it. Have you and Dwight figured things out yet?”

“Figured WHAT out?” Kenneth started to ask. “What do you— Oh, um… You mean, have we gotten… Closer? Uh, yes. We have…”

“I thought so,” Beth smiled a little. “I think I noticed you two were falling for each other when you were around ten.”

“Eheh, uhhh, took us a little longer to notice that,” Kenneth admitted.

“Your Mother and I— Ramona and I, we were closer too. Much closer than friends.”

“Oh— But— But you’re not Ann!” It was the only thing Kenneth could think to say, and he felt rather stupid for saying it. THIS was probably why Beth and Mother had had their fight! There had been a third girl!

“I am,” Beth said. “My full name is Annabeth. Ann, Beth. I started using Beth a few months after Ramona… Stopped seeing me. I was furious with her then, when her Mother found us out, and she just went to her side… Ramona nodded along as her Mother called us the most horrid things you could imagine, and then she said ‘Yes, Mother. I know. This was wrong. I won’t do it anymore.’”

Even without being there to see it, Kenneth could picture it clearly. He’d done similar things many times with his Father. There were times where Father had screamed at him, making awful accusations and demand he ‘confess’ to a wrongdoing he hadn’t actually committed. And, eventually, Kenneth never tried to deny anymore. He’d just nod, and dully agree with whatever Father was saying, only wanting to please him so that his upcoming punishment might be less severe.

“And I was angry,” Beth admitted. “I couldn’t believe that she wouldn’t try to fight for herself— for us. I thought she was telling me that I was less important to her than a woman who treated her like garbage. But, over time I realized that she’d just been terrified. She hadn’t known what else to do… When I heard she was getting married, my heart broke again. When I heard WHO her husband was going to be, I was horrified. But, I was still so upset that I couldn’t make myself—“

“You knew my Father?” Kenneth interrupted.

“Unfortunately,” Beth said. “Known him since we were kids, Francis was my cousin.”

“What?!”

“It meant I had to spend a lot of time with him,” Beth explained. “As a child, he wasn’t so bad. He was actually a good friend. He was scared of most things, and always tense, and I felt like I had to protect him. His Father— My Uncle— was a violent alcoholic. I didn’t understand that back then, but I know your Father was treated horribly.”

Kenneth nodded. Father HAD told him tales of his own childhood in the past, and Kenneth had gotten the impression that Grandpa had just been a carbon copy of Father.

“Francis turned eighteen and became a soldier— Not a guard like you. At that time, there was a dispute over a piece of territory, so he was sent into battle. And, I’m not sure what happened to him there, but when he came back he wasn’t so timid anymore, and he started to drink like a fish. I went to see him once just to check in on how he was doing, and he was so drunk that he couldn’t hold a conversation. He became enraged partway through and by the time I was leaving, I’d gotten a black eye.”

Kenneth DID know some of what had happened to Father when he’d seen combat. Father had gotten shot in the chest, a little further to the left and he would have been killed. Father had seen his friends die. Father had watched as a group of enemy soldiers decided to execute one of his friends even after he’d surrendered and begged for his life. “I know some really bad things happened to him back then,” Kenneth said.

“I’m sure they did. He never told me what they were,” Beth said. “And, he was just… Always drunk and angry, and that made him violent. He just started to hate everything and everyone, and he wouldn’t talk to me anymore. He shut me out, and spent all his time at the bar. He became especially cruel to women, and started to hone in on any that he thought might be easy to manipulate. Your Mother was… She was an extremely traumatized and fragile person, she really did seem to just resign herself to being abused. She told me once that I almost didn’t feel like a ‘real person’ to her because I didn’t hurt her. Abuse was what she expected, it was what made something ‘real’.”

Kenneth thought he knew THAT feeling too. When he’d first met Dwight, he’d been confused because Dwight never yelled, called him names, or hit him. He became even more perplexed when Dwight never made a sudden ‘turn’ and started to harm him. After so much time accepting that physical contact always equalled pain, being hugged felt strange and unnatural.

“So, I know why he went after Ramona,” Beth said. “And, when I learned they were getting married, I broke down with fear and anger. I wasn’t invited to the wedding of course, and I don’t think I would have been able to attend if I had been. I didn’t speak to her again for over two years after that, and by then you had been born. I’m not sure if you remember this or not, but you were hiding behind Ramona the entire time we were talking.”

“I kind of remember it,” Kenneth said. “I remember going to church with Mother a couple times, anyway. Father didn’t like us going, though.”

“Probably didn’t want her to see me there,” Beth said. “Our conversation— The last time I would ever speak to Ramona— wasn’t the best. It was like we were two strangers that just happened to know everything about each other. We talked about the weather of all things, neither saying a word about what we meant to one another. As we talked, I saw in the both of you the same fear and tension that had been in Francis when he was little. I knew he must have been treating you just as badly as I’d been afraid of, but I didn’t know what I could do.

“Around then, my parents both wanted to have me married to their friends’ son,” Beth said. “I wanted nothing to do with that man, so I told them that I felt I was being called in a different direction, that my love belonged to God. I knew they wouldn’t stop me from dedicating my life to God, and that meant they could no longer force me into marriage. So, that’s when I came here to take care of the children. I tried to focus on them, to stop thinking about what was happening to you and Ramona.

“But, then I found out she was… Gone. And, beyond the loss I felt, I also knew that you were going to be alone with my cousin. A couple times I tried to go to your house to do… Something for you— Just to SEE you, my Ramona’s son, and try to keep an eye on what was happening to you. But, your Father would never answer the door for me. I couldn’t even look through the windows since the curtains were always drawn.”

“I didn’t know anyone ever tried to check on me,” Kenneth admitted. “I thought everybody here just ignored what was going on.”

“Most people did, unfortunately,” Beth said. “I’m sure others knew what was happening, and if more people had tried, something WOULD have been done about it… Then, one morning, Dwight came downstairs with you. I knew I was supposed to scold him for bringing someone else in here— And for leaving the building after dark, since that’s the only way he could have MET you— But, when I recognized who you were, I couldn’t say one word to him. Later, all I could tell him was that I was so happy he’d made a friend, and that he could bring you to visit whenever he wanted. Finally, I had a way to look after you, even if only a little. I thought since I’d failed Ramona, I’d protect her son for her instead.”

“Wow,” Kenneth said. “So, someone really WAS looking out for me?”

“All of us here were,” Beth nodded. “When the others started to see the signs you were being abused, that gave me the push I needed to go to the police— I knew I wasn’t overreacting, other people were worried too. I couldn’t believe the police didn’t intervene, and I’m so sorry.”

“It’s okay,” Kenneth told her. “You TRIED. That’s more than anyone else ever did.”

“I should have tried harder.”

“You did what you could,” Kenneth said. “The rest was up to the police. They’re the ones that failed.”

“I’m sorry…” Beth repeated hoarsely. “I want Ramona to know that I… That I tried…”

Kenneth shook his head, “It’s… I— You want to know why I’m here? Why I’d ever come back? Before she died, my Mother wrote me this letter. It took me a really long time to open it, but I did recently. She talked a lot about you in it, she missed you so much. She… She wrote that she wanted me to tell you that she never… She never stopped loving you. That was the last thing she wanted, her dying wish was for both of us to know how much she loved us.”

“Do you have the letter…?”

Kenneth took it from his pocket. “Got it right here…” he said, handing it to her.

Beth read it over, sniffling the whole way through. The note shook in her hands and when she was done, she was crying harder, making Kenneth start tearing up again too. He moved to hug her, and she squeezed back.

“I think she’d be really happy to know that you were trying to keep me safe all those years,” Kenneth told her. “And, you’re going to see her in Heaven, you can tell her all about it.”

Beth squeezed him tighter. “She’s going to like seeing how you’ve grown up. She’ll be so glad that you and Dwight have each other, that you’re loved.”

“You’re loved, too,” Kenneth said. “Dwight says you and the others are the closest thing he had to parents, all the kids here now feel the same way. And, I guess it’s the same for me. You looked after me when my Mother couldn’t and my Father wouldn’t.”

They released each other, and Kenneth asked her to come back downstairs to talk to his friends. He introduced her to them AS Ann, which surprised them both.

“I don’t remember you ever telling me your full name,” Dwight admitted. “I’m sorry.”

“I probably never did,” Beth said. “I hardly ever used it in those days.”

“Thank you for watching over Paulson,” Bryce said. “I’m glad he had some people who were kind to him.”

***

They started to leave town shortly after that. Beth knew Mother had always loved her. Kenneth knew an adult had wanted to protect him. Kenneth had done everything he’d come here for, and now he’d never have to return again.

But, maybe he’d want to visit Beth again someday.

He’d prefer if she came to see HIM, though. If SHE was the one to make the trip, he wouldn’t have to worry about seeing his childhood home.

They had to pass it once more on their way out, and Kenneth tried not to look at it. He was glad that someone else was going to have good memories inside of it, but to him it would always look like a prison.

He could admit that the walls looked a little brighter now, though.
