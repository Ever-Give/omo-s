Anita walked along the road to meet Mikey on their first date, a visit to the new Park lands, newly opened on the old industrial site, acres of land redeveloped by the city council for the use of the local community, walk ways with gardens, fountains, a tram line, boating pond and exhibits explaining the history of the area through the decades,

They met as arranged at 9am to enter using the free tickets local residents were allocated, he kissed her on the cheek as they met and embraced, she didn’t expect that but was thrilled by it as she had liked Mikey since they first met in a group of friends months before,

They slowly walked and chatted along the pathways admiring the sights, it was a bright dry day very busy with visitors, she was glad she wore her high waist - mid thigh light blue denim skirt, her bare legs in mid heel white sandals maximised all her 5’ 3” making her shapely legs look longer, her sleeveless white blouse and light jacket enough for the occasion,

The initial leisurely walk along the paths took them past multiple flower gardens from all over the world, they saw a kiosk and bought a bottle of water each, there were many sights to stop at and admire as they made their way along the path, after a while they saw the tram, they got on and slowly the ride took them up to the far side at the boating pond, they got off and put their plastic water bottles now empty in a litter bin, a stall with small free samples of cherry and apricot liqueurs came into view, they tasted them both, a short time later another kiosk on the walk, they bought ice creams, they decided to rest so sat on a bench overlooking the large boating pond,

As they sat chatting enjoying the ice cream she felt a twinge in her bladder, early warning her first pee of the day was at 7.00am this morning, not to worry she thought there would be an opportunity to go later when she felt the need more, she had a quick glance around to see out of curiosity any toilet signs but there was nothing, her watch read 11.15am, they were having a nice time together and after about a half hour sitting together she noticed the time was now 11.45am and mentioned how quickly the time had passed, she felt another reminder, she crossed her legs in response, her need to pee had increased this last half hour,

Not wanting to mention anything of her growing need to her date as she was shy about it and not wanting to make a loo break a thing, she thought there will be an opportunity sooner or later, he will probably have to go sometime soon too, we could go together as he might mention it first saving her the embarrassment of having to say she needs to find a ladies, it would come up in conversation I’m sure and they would go together when they see one of the toilet buildings bound to be dotted around the park ... but she hadn’t seen one so far,

He suggested they moved on and start heading off up ahead to the old rail line to see the steam locomotive attraction, she happily agreed as the walk would get her moving again as sat on the bench the increased legs crossing in response to the twinges she felt might draw attention to her need, she decided if they pass toilets she would have to casually excuse herself and go, any other day she would have gone by now usually about 10.30 - 11am when at work was her normal pee time, as the park was busy thinking ahead she thought the ladies might be busy she may have to wait in line, if there is a line of ladies reaching outside the loo building she hoped he would go to the gents so as not to be able to see her standing in line as she wasn’t sure she could stand still as she waited, she could be jiggling around obviously needing to go, if so she would try and disguise her need as best as she could.

She’s only had a mug of tea and glass of orange juice at home and that bottle of water this morning, oh and the small liqueurs too.... time was moving on and she usually did need to pee before now anyway so shouldn’t be surprised, she will deal with it soon, get it out the way so they can go on enjoying their day,

As they reached the attraction they stood at the railing admiring the huge engine, she had been looking but hadn’t seen a toilet on the way, she glanced at her watch it was now 11.55am and as suspected she found herself pacing a little so she casually stepped along the path looking at the engine pretending to show an interest,

As she stepped along the path she looked both ways for signs of the ladies again, if she saw a building she would have to take the opportunity say something to excuse herself and go, she wasn’t worried about peeing herself yet she could hold it for longer but proper pee dancing to hold it in wasn’t far away, she didn’t want everyone especially Mikey to know not only that she had to pee but how much she had to go, very embarrassing,

Mikey lost interest quickly and suggested they carry on further to see what lay ahead, Anita couldn’t agree more as the engine to her was boring and walking suited her in her present need, they quickly came across a small tent with a lady dressed as a gypsy stood outside, she wished them in to read their fortunes, they giggled at this then Mikey said for a laugh he was going in so he did and Anita paced around waiting on his return, she glanced around quickly for a ladies again but still none in sight, there was a bench opposite the tent she sat there and crossed her legs bouncing her leg over her knee, she has to pee soon... 5 mins later Mikey came out laughing Anita rose to greet him, at the same time the lady appeared from the tent and wished Anita in, Mikey urged her to go in and try it as its fun, reluctantly she went in followed by the lady,

5 minutes later Anita’s experience was over and she exchanged predictions with Mikey as they walked back the way they came, her need to pee was now constant on her mind, her anxiety growing she was going to have to say something so she could go find a toilet real soon but what to say?, walking with him her jacket now folded over her crossed arms she knew she wouldn’t be able to stop walking and stand still, she would try and move naturally when standing but she was really needing to pee, maybe if he noticed her awkward stance and shifting on the spot it might trigger a thought in his mind and suggest going to find the ladies toilet saving her the embarrassment, and she could just agree to that saying something like she was about to suggest same, surely he had to pee soon too...,

They reach the steam engine again and they stopped to look at it once more, she stood beside him shifting discreetly changing her weight from foot to foot doing her utmost to not break into an unmistakable pee dance,

Mikey hadn’t noticed or said anything to her about her inability to stand still, it wasn’t a cold day, no reason to be on the move, ... what to say she thought,

Seconds later she realises she’s about to break into a pee dance, she steps backwards away and spins around seeing a bench she calls to him, she’s going to rest her feet and quickly walks over and plants her bottom down crossing her legs trying not to wiggle too much but she can’t help it, here body is trying to void her bladder she’s fighting to hold it in, she’s not hovering over a toilet... she’s not ready to let out her pee.... maybe sitting for a minute jiggling here can help her regain her composure while she thinks what to say, she has to go now, as soon as he’s finished with the engine she has to say something so she can go pee, it has to be their next stop, she’s been hoping to come across a toilet to release her now desperate need to pee for ages, shes admitting to herself she’s actually really bursting and has been discreetly holding it in for half the morning...

What to say......

Hi yea sorry about that, first time I’ve copied and pasted to here from notebook on an iPad, don’t know another way, any help or suggestions I will take on board..

Thanks for the positive comments, first time I’ve tried a fiction story, although it’s fiction it’s based loosely on an experience I had years ago, its all in my head, just got to get it typed down, part 2 will be sometime tomorrow, looks like it will be in 3 parts,

Great story!

I like it that Anita is needing to wee, but don’t ask for a loo.

She is waiting so long for a natural opportunity, but she did not get a chance to take a much needed pee.

She is needing to go since so long, she did putted it off for hours, but now she can’t anymore. What will she do?

What is about Mikey? Does he not need to pee? Does he not go, because he don’t want to give her a chance to wee, because he like it to make her wait and hold?

Or did he not even think about it, that girls are needing to wee sometimes ?

I am curious how it go’s on.

}}

Thanks, Mikey thoughts will be revealed soon..... so far it’s all about Anita’s struggle, to be the perfect lady companion, she thinks a lady visibly or audibly needing to pee will be off putting for a male.. make her less attractive... quite the opposite...

Desperate Date - Part 2

What to say....

Can I just say.. can we go find the ladies now, I need a wee... or, are there toilets around here?

Hmmmmm He might not reply positively or be a gentleman and grasp my situation!

Or he might ask why I hadn’t said something earlier..?

Embarrassing that I’ve been to too shy to mention I’ve been needing to pee all this time, grown ups don’t bother about these things.. but I do...

I really should just say Mikey can you help me, I desperately need to find the loo... I’m bursting!

No no I can’t, that’s so so soooo embarrassing......

I can’t find the words,

I need to be discreet....

Why hasn’t he said he needs to go !?.... that would help me out a lot..

I know what I can say she thought....

I will ask if he’s hungry, it’s about lunchtime, 12.20 to be exact, we can go back to the cafe at the entrance, it’s the only building I’ve seen that there is sure to be a ladies,

I can try to make it to there, not sure if I can without dancing, or worse pressing my hand up my skirt to hold myself while dancing around.....that’s a real possibility...

I need to try...

It’s a walk down past the pond to the tram, I will be squirming and bobbing sitting on the tram,

That would be a give away, he will know I’m bursting then, gosh.....

Or we might see a toilet as we walk the path before we get to the tram!

Even better! and I will just excuse myself and say I need to go, ... but I didn’t notice a loo on the way up? Although to be fair I wasn’t looking for one back then before we reached the seats at the pond..,

If I have to dance I will deal with him knowing that I’m bursting somehow, but for now I will try to make it without him knowing...

I’m bursting ... I need to pee, he doesn’t need to know I’m so bursting, needing to pee is fine, I can say I need to use the ladies, that’s ok....

No it’s not!, I can’t....

I can hardly sit still I’m so desperate, I will give it a minute more then I’m going to have to suggest lunch to get me moving again towards a toilet...

She gets up from the bench, control of her bladder partially regained but for how long? She casually walks over to where he’s stood at the railing,

Hey Mikey how about lunch? Are you hungry?

More thirsty than anything babe, you ?

I just realised it’s almost 12.30, I thought once your done here we could go to the cafe for food before it gets busy, how about it ?

She turns to walk down the path before she hears his reply, She realises as she’s been stood talking to him she’s been slowly pee dancing on the spot for that few seconds, crossing her legs to pinch the top of her under carriage with obvious curtsies in between the leg cross overs, she’s about to burst ... the constant battle to hold back the pee flood is straining...

He’s probably guessed now I’m struggling no make it, gosh I’m absolutely bursting...

I need to clamp my muscles shut even more to hold my pee in long enough until I make it to the loo... where the bloody hell are they ?!

Her walking style has changed, walking slower, her legs slightly crossing over each other with each step, her hips sway gently,

Mikey replies... Yea I’m done here... and walks to catch up with her,

They see the boating pond to the left, Hey ! let’s grab a boat and row around the pond suggests Mikey,

Alarmed at the thought Anita thinks No way !

Anita responds..... Were here all day, we can do it later, lunch first, yea....

But we’re here now, replied Mikey, might as well while we’re here, won’t take long, 20 mins ? what’s the hurry for lunch, you hungry ?

Not hungry, just frantic to pee but you don’t know that or you would understand she thought, besides if I were to be sitting in that boat facing him as he oared, in that low seat position, in my condition as I am now....

My legs would be scissoring, opening and closing at the knees rapid trying to hold in my pee, in this short skirt, he would have an easy view right up between my legs, my skimpy white satin pants barely covering my privates in full view!!

Not lady like at all... no chance !

And in that position i wouldn't be in full control and peeing myself would be a real possibility... unavoidable really...

I would be mortified!

I couldn’t just stand up and hold myself and pee dance as a last resort to try and hold it, I would fall out the boat!

So double no chance!!

Yea I’m famished, let’s go eat, they do burgers and chips she replied... boat later...

Mikey stopped walking..... Well... we may not come back this way though, I mean probably miss the chance if we don’t do it now, what do you say..?

Dam he’s insisting...

I can’t... he must know I’m bursting already ... he can’t Not have noticed ?

I hope he is unaware though of just how desperate I am....

Maybe I’ve done a good job at hiding it while I’ve been desperately holding it in all this time...

But I can’t go on much longer... he has to know....

If I tell him I can’t sit in that boat because I’m bursting for the loo and actually almost wetting myself then he would understand.. surely ?

Gosh if only I could say those words.....

I have to tell him, .....

I will suggest we go to the loo first,

I won’t say I’m desperate, just a comfort break, somewhere nearby here, if there is a loo near here?

Then we can go boating....

I just have to pee first...

If he manages to convince me to climb in that boat now it will be curtains for me for sure, I won’t make the loo....

Is there a way I could sit low on the bench side on, knees high together, and pee myself through my pants slowly ?... without it bursting out noticeably in a loud hissing sound?

Maybe.... the first release would be strong and it would flood the material of my pants quickly, there’s so little of it... then my pee would flow down under me like a water tap running ... medium flow... if I can close the flow off a bit, it would be a steady stream, not loud and hissing out of me.....

Would my pee smell ? Don’t think so... it’s pure and sterile when it’s fresh, it won’t be yellow either almost clear....... the boat is bound have a puddle in the bottom already......

Gosh I’m in a terrible situation... we’re having such a lovely day together, I don’t want to ruin it by disagreeing, what he says makes sense, we are here, this is a good time to boat around the pond, but not if your bursting to pee as I am,

What will I do.....

He’s good at holding his pee, still not a word.... I can’t rely on him saying something about him needing to pee now, that’s gone....

I have to do something.... on my own... make a decision...... what will I do???

Hi I too copy from notes on an iPad. Once you paste in there’s an option at the bottom for ‘paste as plain text’. If you clock this it is much clearer to read. Hope that helps.

P.S. great story

Thanks for that, I will look for that .. for part 2 I managed to change the text height and colour, hope that helps ...

Desperate Date Part 3 - Mikeys thoughts...

Mikey finished off his can of sugary soft drink as he waited for Anita at the entrance,

He was a little nervous as he liked her, she was pretty and bubbly and he didn’t want to mess up as he hoped it would go well so he can see her again,

He chose to wear his casual tapered jeans, tennis shoes, a blue round neck T-shirt and sports zipper,

He could see her walking along through the scattering of visitors, wow nice legs and nice round breasts, held tight in that white blouse he noticed as she approached him with a wide friendly smile saying Hi,

They embraced, he kissed her on the cheek, pulling her body close to his, she giggled as they separated to walk together through the entrance,

Read parts 1 and 2 first before continuing for this to make any sense, it’s fast forward to the bench with ice cream...

She is really lovely, so chatty and smiley, her legs are awesome, that skirt rides up a fair way when she’s seated with her legs crossed,

She’s switched legs a few times now, each time she tugs at her skirt to pull it down a bit to cover some more of those gorgeous thighs,

Anita has pointed out its 11.45 already, we’ve sat here long enough we should move on up the path to the next big attraction, the steam engine,

Well it’s a huge engine for sure Mikey thought, more on his mind was he was feeling the need to pee, almost 12 o’clock and neither of us have been yet, Anita hasn’t mentioned stopping for a loo yet, that’s strange because earlier she looked like she was holding it in a bit, hard to tell, maybe the leg crossing and shifting on the bench she was trying to get more comfortable ?

But I suspect by this time of the day surely she was needing a bit, as I do....

And looking at the way she’s standing at the rail here at the steam engine she’s kinda always on the move, not standing still much at all, as if she can’t, maybe she’s needing to go a good bit but she doesn’t seem interested in a loo break, I am interested in finding a loo if she isn’t, I won’t say anything until she does unless I’m getting desperate, then I will suggest we find a loo, I will suggest we move on to see what’s up ahead briefly, off we go...

Well what’s this .. lol a gypsy.... fortune telling ha ha this could be fun.. Anita I have to try this, won’t be long...

Mikey emerges from the tent a few minutes later giggling, sees Anita sitting on a bench opposite,

Anita you have to try this, please go on in, its fun lol... Anita goes in the small tent followed by the lady,

Mikeys thoughts return to his growing need to pee, he thinks right! When she comes out of that tent I’m going to ask her if she wants to find a loo, because I do...

He saunters further along the path killing time waiting for Anita... as he does the path turns left behind mature bushes and conifer trees, and there nestled out of site he catches a glimpse of a gable end of a small white building, he investigates... its a toilet block, gents and ladies... cool he said,

He goes in the gents, 2 urinals and 1 cubicle, he unzips at a urinal and let’s his pee out, releasing a long stream of pee.... ah that’s much better he says,

Zips up and washes hands, walks back to the tent just in time as Anita emerges to join him, they set off back the way they came giggling sharing their tarot card reading experiences....

*010*2022-03-08 19:01

Part 4 - Mikeys thoughts continued,

This is a relaxing nice walk back after stopping at that fortune reader, that was fun, broke up the day... and I got to pee too... feel much better now,

Here we are again back at the engine and Anita is jiggling around a lot, perhaps my thoughts earlier that she’s been showing signs she’s needing to visit the loo are true, she can’t stand still... looks as if she’s pretty desperate to use the ladies,

He hears Anita call to him, she’s away to sit on that bench to rest her feet she says,

Mikey thinks back to the gypsy 10 minutes before........

It completely slipped my mind when she came out the gypsy tent ...

To mention to her I stumbled upon a toilet block just meters from the tent, hidden from view, and perhaps she would like to go, as we are here, as I’ve just gone when she was in the tent...

If she is needing the loo it would have made sense to take the opportunity...

Pity about that, I’m sure if she really needs a wee she will say so, probably enjoying herself too much at the moment,

However ... looking at her sat on the bench over there, she really looks like she’s actually bursting, she can’t sit still, and is bending over looking along the path both ways trying to see something....?

I will stand here for a bit, enjoy the sights, she will let me know when she’s ready to move, wonder what she wants to go see next....?

A few minutes later.... Hey Mikey how about lunch? Are you hungry?

Ok so we’ve chatted a bit and Anita suggests going all the way down to the cafe for lunch,

I’ve not had much choice she’s already on her way....

Strange though... there’s hot dog stands and burger bars closer ?

Why go all the way down there when we can eat something from one of these places ?

Anyway she looks determined to have her way.. that’s fine if she wants to go all the way back down to eat at the cafe ...

But Ahaa...... I think I know why.... she hasn’t said but Anita needs to pee.. I’m sure of that,

And ... she has looked this last while.. say 45 mins or so like she’s needing to go pretty bad now, well she’s almost dancing most of the time, even now when she’s walking she looks like she’s desperate...

So maybe she wants to go to a place for food where she can use the loo first....

Ok ... that kinda makes sense...

Here’s the boating pond now.....I’m going to ask her to row around the pond first, before lunch, she would like that... I’m sure she would, if I’m right, and Anita needs to go pee first, I mean she does look like she’s bursting, then I can understand that, she would want to be comfortable sitting in the boat, I will ask if she wants to go on the boat, see what she says....

Hey ! let’s grab a boat and row around the pond suggests Mikey,

*011*2022-03-09 12:12

Part 5 - End

Mikey stopped walking..... Well... we may not come back this way though, I mean probably miss the chance if we don’t do it now, what do you say..?

I have to do something.... on my own... make a decision...... what will I do???

Anita stops walking and turns back to face Mikey, no longer walking, she’s standing, facing Mikey, squirming, full on pee dancing, legs scissoring....

Mikey I couldn’t go on the boat if I wanted to.... not now,

I need to find a ladies...

It’s urgent, really urgent....

Wow I’ve owned up, there’s no doubt about my predicament now.. gosh I’m about to burst.. please don’t do this.. not now!.....

Ok babe... I kinda was sure you we’re needing to pee....but not how bad....you didn’t say?

The pressure on her pee hole is unbearable, despite her pee dance she feels her pee is about to escape... she thrusts her hand up under her skirt holding herself and crosses her legs over tightly.....

Oohhh this is so embarrassing!!..... I need to hold it in...

Anita, her situation overwhelming......snaps a response back at Mikey,

No.. I didn’t say, ....

Because I didn’t want any point of our day to be focussed on stopping what we’re doing to find a ladies for me!....

So I’ve been holding it in...... waiting for a ladies to come along... it didn’t,

Now .... because I’ve been holding it in for such a long time ....I’m frantic to go, been bursting for ages..... so I can’t go on the boat! .....

Im almost Pissing myself !! ...She exclaimed,

Now please help me... !

Mikey, startled by Anita’s reaction responds ..... Wow wow babe... ok ok I understand.. I didn’t realise you were so close to having an accident......let’s get you sorted....

Mikey looks beyond his pee dancing date and sees two female ‘Visitor Assists’ bright clothing, hi viz, etc,

I will ask these ladies for directions to the nearest ladies loo... wait here,

Anita stands squirming holding herself .. her skirt pulled up, just covering her bottom, the full length of her legs and thighs on view ... she looks around, there’s a bench over there backed onto some shrubs, she waddles over and sits on the edge, scissoring her legs open and closed now with both hands pressing into her pee hole..

Mikey approaches the visitor assists,

Hi can you help me please...

Yes sir off course, how can we help,

My friend needs to visit the ladies, can you point me in the direction of the nearest loo please,

Off course, the lady opens a folder with a plan map of the park,

Let’s see........ So we are here...... continue straight on this path, there are facilities just a little further beyond where the tram line stops,

How far is that,?

I’d say a brisk walk no more than 10 minutes..

Hmm ok, .....not sure she can make that, was hoping you were going to suggest something closer.. is there a staff building or somewhere much closer in this area she could use,?

Sorry sir, not that I can think of....let’s see....there’s another facility in the opposite direction, but I’d suggest it’s not any closer ...probably a little further...

Walk by the steam engine, keep going straight... past some activities on the left then turn to your left, .... it’s kinda set back from view,

Mikey knows it, just after the fortune teller....

Ok thanks you’ve been very helpful, just one more question before I get back to share the bad news... why are the facilities not clearly identified ?

We’re just opened Sir and some contractors are behind such as the fitting of the directional posts, in fact they’re due to be fitted over the next couple of nights I hear, we are here to assist, and there are big ‘you are here’ maps dotted around,

The toilets are intentionally set back out of direct view so not to spoil the ambiance of the setting, a lot of thought has gone in at the planning stage for maximum visitor enjoyment, Sorry for any inconvenience,

No it’s fine... I wasn’t looking for these maps, thanks for the help,

No problem sir, if you look there’s a map board over there near the pond,

Ok thanks again,

Mikey returns to Anita, he sits beside her on the bench, she’s not moved, holding herself, legs scissoring....

10 minutes walk down that way babe....

Anita looks over her shoulder in the general direction Mikey pointed....

Gosh..... so far.... Anita realises she’s doomed, she can’t make it....

Right let’s go, you can make it... suggests Mikey,

No no, wait.... I can’t move right now, .... if I stand up I will piss myself.....

I need to try and get a hold of this first, don’t think I can make it....

Let me think......

Anita’s thoughts turn to Mikey....

What about you? You must be needing to go by now? No?

We’ve been together all day, it’s now what? About 12.45 in the afternoon and you haven’t mentioned a loo break once,

I’ve been needing for about 2 hours, bursting at least the last hour....

You some kind of super holder or something ?!

Anita’s situation is not improving... she feels a wetness on her fingers as she’s squeezing into herself.....

Gosh! I’m losing it, ..... she’s wriggling and scissoring now like crazy ... trying to keep her pee inside her,

So babe, well you see, when you were in having your fortunes read, as I waited for you, I stumbled upon a loo just beside there,

I’ve been.....

Anita’s downloads this new information.....

What...? We were at a ladies..... and you didn’t mention anything?

I could have had relief over a half hour ago!

Babe I didn’t know, you didn’t say.. I was going to say actually when you came out the tent, but I genuinely forgot, as I wasn’t needing anymore, it just slipped my mind... Sorry!

Ok ok its not your fault, my fault for not sharing how bad I was needing to go,

Gosh I’ve been bursting all this time!

The gypsy lady would have noticed, I was shifting a lot in that plastic seat as she read the cards....

A jet of Anita’s pee leaves her, no mistake, her pants feel wet to the touch....

Mikey you need to stand up, ....in front of me, with your back to me... Quickly!don’t turn around, I need to go here....

What Babe ?

Shush... quickly turn around, don’t look at me......

Her mind wandered to the last few times she’s had to pee in public, absolutely bursting as she is now, but that’s for another time....

This time it’s too public, she can’t squat pants at her knees.... needs to pee through them....

Don’t move Mikey, I can’t hold it in anymore, I’ve started going already....

She stops pressing, her hands held slightly forward to hide a view of her panties, to protect what’s left of her modesty,

She relaxes.... immediately a strong stream of pee quickly soaks her panties then escapes through the material splashing onto and through the bench slats, landing on the concrete below, her skirt just up high enough at the back to avoid any damage,

Anita is so relieved to relax and let her pee out..... such a feeling,

30 seconds later her stream ebbs off to a trickle, she pushes out a few last spurts into her panties emptying her bladder.....

Anita smiles......What relief at last.......
