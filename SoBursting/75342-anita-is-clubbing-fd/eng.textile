Anita is going clubbing on a girlie overnight stay in a strange town.

So excited to be out with these 5 girls from work and I’m room sharing with my best friend from my section, So looking forward to the the next 24 hrs,

We’re going uptown to the nice bars and clubs, we managed to book a nice hotel not too far from uptown, it’s too far to walk but a short cab ride gets you where you need to be,

When we arrived we went shopping for an few hour then back to the hotel, we chilled out a bit in our rooms then it was time to start to get ready to go out,

We got dressed and headed to the bar downstairs for a few drinks to get the party started! Then it’s to a restaurant for dinner at 8.00pm then bars and clubs,

I wore a halter neck cat suit, tight bodice top half (no need for a bra) then loose over the legs, short at the bottom above the ankle, high shoes,

It had a low back, so I could undo behind the neck for it to be rolled down to use the loo so I didn’t need a friend to help me,

The evening really started after the restaurant, we went to a bar, after a few drinks I was needing to wee for first time in the pub since I went when we were leaving the restaurant around an hour earlier, it was now 10.30pm,

I went to the ladies to find the toilet floor was dirty and wet, I didn’t want to chance it in case part of my cat suit hit the floor when rolled down to pee, as I wasn’t bursting yet I left without peeing, I can wait till the next bar I thought,

The girls were having a great time so I waited a while then about 10.45pm I suggested we move on as I was shifting now needing to pee, I wanted to go to the next pub,

No one was moving, I said to my friend to help me get the girls moving, about 10 mins later we were moving, as we headed out some of the girls went to pee, I was pacing waiting outside with the others, as time was pushing on someone suggested we skipped the pub, go straight to the club, I just wanted to peeeee... any bathroom now...... we went on to the Club passing by the pub... I didn’t want to go in the pub just to pee so I continued to hold to our final destination,

The night air was chilly and with the wine I had I was crossing my legs to help me hold in my pee as we walked, it was a slow 10 min walk to the club and when we got there I was bursting and a bit tipsy,

It was almost 11.15pm, I hadn’t peed now in nearly 2 hours and realised I had to wait a little longer, there was a small line at the club entrance!

We joined the line, I took my position in amongst the girls for cover, I was badly needing the loo, I pressed my hand in between my crossed legs visually covered by the girls, the door men made us wait there for a minute until the crowd in front paid at the desk and moved on,

My need was urgent so I whispered to my friend

“Gosh, I’m bursting, can we go find the loo as soon as were inside...”,

She giggled and said “Really?, let’s get settled first eh, can’t be that bad? we’ve just left the pub?”,

I smiled back and replied,

“Well can we get settled quickly then, i didn’t go at the pub, I’m really needing..”,

The door men ushered us forward to pay at the desk, i was second from last in line, the line was stop/start as each girl paid and showed I.D. If requested,

We were all in full view of the door persons, (a lady too) i couldn’t hold myself now I’m in public view really bursting so I had to cross my legs and curtsy a few times to control my need to pee, for anyone watching it was obvious I was desperate for a wee but I couldn’t help it, I needed the loo badly,

It was my turn to pay, I handed over the money as I faced the girl,

I.D. Please, she said,

As I went in my bag to get it I couldn’t stand still, my legs were scissoring,

Stand over there please we need to do a search,

Bewildered I stepped over to where I was told and the door lady came to me to search, it was my bag they wanted to search,

As she did so my legs were shaking waiting to be let on my way,

“Had any drugs tonight?” She asked,

“No nothing, I don’t “ I replied, I’m shifting on the spot...

“You ok? You look nervous? “

“ yea yea I’m fine..” I knew she was referring to my inability to stand still desperately holding in my pee and with those shoes on...

“Had much to drink?”

“Eh.. just a few glasses of wine..” ........I’m stood trying not to pee dance,

“Do you know how many drinks?”,

“Errr maybe 4... sorry .... it’s just that I’m bustin for the loo...” I blurted out, curtsying to emphasise my need...

She looked at my sympathetically and pointed for me to go through the barrier,

The girls were waiting on me, we muttered amongst ourselves as we made our way through the place to the bar at the back far away wall,

We had seating booked but we didn’t know where, one of the girls started asking what we wanted to drink, l shouted over the loud music as I pee danced but pretended to dance “CAN WE FIND THE SEATING FIRST... IM BURSTING FOR THE LOO”,

Don’t think she heard me, she was mouthing ‘wine’ to me lifting an imaginary glass up to her mouth,

I stepped up to the bar, leaning over as I did so, legs crossed I squeezed myself between my legs, I asked, “where’s the toilets please?”,

The guy pointed over my head motioning to the far back diagonally behind us,

Another of our group at the same time was showing a lady staff member the booking detail, the lady nodded and motioned us to follow her,

A glass of wine was thrust in my hand, the girls were disappearing through the crowds in front of me following the lady, I decide to follow with the intention of putting my glass on our table and running to the ladies, I’ve been bursting for a while now ...

We are walked up the stairs to the mezzanine floor overlooking the dance floor, there’s about 10 booths and a bar area,

We are shown to our empty booth, I bend forward cross legged to put my glass down i bob up and down a few times as I stand up straight, now I’m pee dancing on the spot, I search to find one of the girls gaze to let someone know where I’m going,

I meet one of the girls eyes and I shout over the load music “TOILET” as I point towards the bar at the top of the stairs, she looks back puzzled and says “what” I step closer to her grabbing her arm to catch her full attention,

“IM GOING TO TOILET, OK,” she thinks for a sec and says “WAIT A SEC I WILL COME WITH YOU”

Another of the girls engages in conversation with her distracting her .... I’m squirming, I pull at her arm again

“ ARE YOU COMING... I NEED TO GO, ... IM BURSTING”

She nods yes, takes a sip of her wine and puts her glass down,

We head to the bar to ask where the toilet is, there must be one up here.... I’m scanning for a toilet sign... “EXCUSE ME” I shout to the bar staff over people while I Bob up and down cross legged “WHERE IS THE TOILET PLEASE” Ooh I’m so desperate to pee I’m throbbing down there...

Guy shouts down stairs across from the bar,

Geez I thought there would be one up here....

I shout to my friend “FOLLOW ME, THEY’RE DOWNSTAIRS”

She nods and we head off down stairs along the edge of the dance floor to where I think the toilets are,

We see a sign with arrow, we follow it and we see the door to the ladies, but there’s a line......

I quickly join the line my friend behind, At last I’m at the loo but I need to wait my turn, I’m pee dancing ... I press my hand in holding myself and cross my legs bobbing up and down, some girls come out, we shuffle forward... my friend leans forward close to speak to me,

“WE GO IN TOGETHER, OK?”

I’m stood crossing my legs alternating one over the other while holding myself,

“YEA IF YOU WANT, BUT I NEED TO GO FIRST,”

“LOL OK, YOU LOOK LIKE YOUR GONNA PEE YOURSELF, LOL”

“Goshhh, YEA, IF THIS LINE DOESNT DISAPPEAR I WILL.... OOHHH IM BURSTING!...”

Part 2

A girl vacates a cubicle and we’re next, we’re quickly in closing the door behind,

I’m squirming with one hand pressing into my pee hole, the other trying to undo the fastening at the back of my neck with one hand,

“Gosh... can you help me, Quick I can’t undo it,” my hand leaves the clip and joins the other pressing into my pee hole as I dance on the spot,

My friend undos the clip, the front part of the outfit drops, my exposed pert round 32 D breasts jiggle as I Take a breath and hold...reaching the garment at the hips i quickly pull the suit and panties down in one go to mid thigh, l straddle a high squat over the loo, not a second to soon my pee is forcefully leaving me into the pan..... “Goshhh... .......Ooohh.......thank goodnesssss... “ i exhale as the tension of holding releases.......I’m peeing an embarrassing amount in front of my friend, my jet of pee is strong and noisy... gosh I didn’t have any choice but to let it all out at once ..... phew it’s slowing down now at last....

I stand straight pulling my garments up into place,

We change places in the confined space, she pees while I sort my clothing back in position, slightly embarrassed at the huge flood I just did I try to explain....

“That’s a relief....those glasses of wine earlier......I was bursting for ages....I thought I wasn’t going to make it, would have ruined my night.... .

Right! We’re done here ? Let’s get out there and Party!”,

Hours later......

It’s after 2am, We’re giggling and chatting loudly as we walk along the road a little drunk, just as well I was drinking water too, I’m not as tipsy as the others,

The historic cobbled streets are busy with night revellers as we make our way along the road, we’ve had a great time,

When the music stopped and the lights came up we were hurried by staff out the nearest fire exit finding ourselves in a car park at the rear, we’re outside not allowed back in, and I need to pee again for the umpteenth time tonight,

I didn’t think to visit the loo before we were chucked out the club it all happened so fast,

I have no idea where we are?

I ask the girls does anyone know if we’re headed in the right direction, do we know where we are going?

No one seems concerned,

‘We can ask someone !’ shouts one of the girls...

We’re passing some hot food outlets, someone suggests food, but I’m looking for a taxi,

We go in a busy fast food shop and wait in line to order, twinges in my bladder make me gasp! gosh I could use a loo right now..... we wait for a few minutes then it’s our turn, someone is ordering pizza... we pay ...now we’re waiting for the food,

I’m jiggling as I wait, I cant stand still in this shop, I’m bobbing up and down almost dancing...

I whisper to my friend

“I’m waiting outside, i really need to pee again....” I pace up and down outside the shop,

I need to get transport back to the hotel or find a toilet soon......,

I can’t go in a doorway or alley in an emergency because of my clothing, I would be naked!

I need to find a loo or I will piss myself, I can’t hold it in like I did earlier tonight, I’m tired from earlier.....holding it in for so long....

Please please can we get a move on ......

The girls spill out the shop laughing and carrying on, eating their food in no particular rush, I ask them to get moving along, no one is listening,

I’m so tired, holding in my pee, I could relax at any moment and I would be pissing myself, I’m pee dancing as I stand here in the street looking and searching for somewhere to go, after a few minutes I grab my friends arm and ask her to help me find the toilet, in her drunk state she’s no help, it’s an emergency now, I decide to ask the guys working in the takeaway if I can use their loo, I head for the door, just as I arrive at the entrance I feel some wee escape into my nickers, I automatically press my hand into my pee hole to stop the flow, tightly crossing my legs, I’m bobbing up and down really struggling,

“EXCUSE ME, EXCUSE ME, CAN I USE YOUR LOO PLEASE, IM BURSTING TO PEE, ITS AN EMERGENCY,”

“Sorry, no allowed, please leave doorway”

Another dribble of pee escapes...

“OH PLEASE... IM GOING TO WET MYSELF, I CANT MAKE IT TO ANYWHERE .......” I freeze mid sentence.... it’s like a tap has turned on between my legs, my body has given up, pee is running out over my hand down my crossed legs... I stand gasping legs crossed trying in vain to stop it... it keeps pouring out... it won’t stop.... it still coming out.... I’m pissing myself......im soaked ...... it’s slowing down......I’m empty now....it’s stopped,

I look up, the whole shop is looking at me stood in my puddle.....
