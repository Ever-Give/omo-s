Julia was driving home from work, stuck in the evening traffic. She had been wearing her new white jeans all day, feeling stylish and confident, but now she regretted her choice of clothing.

She had been holding her pee since lunchtime, trying to avoid using the office restroom, which was always crowded and dirty. But now, as she sat in her car, inching along the highway, the urge to pee was becoming unbearable.

Julia shifted in her seat, trying to find a more comfortable position. She crossed her legs tightly, hoping to hold off the urge, but it was no use. The pressure in her bladder was growing stronger by the minute.

As she drove, Julia scanned the sides of the road, looking for a gas station or rest stop, but there was nothing in sight. Her discomfort grew with every passing minute, and she started to feel a growing sense of panic.

Julia tried to distract herself, turning up the radio and singing along to her favorite songs. But every bump in the road made her wince, and every red light felt like an eternity.

She was sweating now, her palms clammy on the steering wheel. Her breaths came in short gasps as she fought to control the urge to pee.

But it was no use. Suddenly, she felt a small spurt of urine escape, wetting her underwear and jeans. Julia gasped in shock and horror, feeling the warm wetness spread across her skin.

She was mortified. She had never been in this situation before, and she didn't know what to do. Her desperation had reached a new level, and she knew she couldn't hold on any longer.

As she approached her apartment complex, Julia made a desperate decision. She pulled over to the side of the road, opened her car door, and stepped out, ignoring the honking horns of the other drivers.

She quickly unbuttoned her jeans and squatted down, feeling the last of her urine trickle out. She was grateful for the cover of darkness, but she still felt embarrassed and exposed.

Julia finally made it home, feeling shaken and humiliated. She knew she would never wear those white jeans again, and she vowed to never hold her pee for so long again. She had learned a painful lesson, but one she would never forget.
