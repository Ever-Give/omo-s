Hi everyone

Her is alittle poem inspired by all the wonderful posts here

You sit on the bus with one leg swinging

While your bladder sets alarm bells ringing

There beside you on the seat

Your shopping bag contains a treat

A bottle of nice sparkling wine

Now ordinarily that would be fine

But when you stretched to take it from the shelf

You very nearly wet yourself!

And then when standing in the queue

Realised how bad you need the loo

You wonder how it came to this

To end up desperate for a piss

Why does the driver go so slow

Doesn’t he know you need to go!

He stops to pick up city slickers

As you worry you might wet your knickers

And the people outside rush like ants

While you try not to wet your pants

Eventually you reach your stop

You feel that you just lost a drop!

And when it comes your time to stand

You grab yourself with your free hand

Now everyone can plainly see

That you are dying for a pee!

Your house is just around the block

But it’ll be a race against the clock

You walk and think it would be bliss

To find a place to squat and piss

But you could never be so bold

Your only option is to hold

You hope that no one stops to speak

For if they do you’ll surely leak

Then as you reach your garden gate

You realise it is too late

For as you fumble for your key

You feel yourself begin to pee

You’re then inside, there’s still a chance

You stand and do a huge pee dance

Close the door, kick off your shoes

There really is no time to lose

At times like this it’s so unfair

The only bathroom is upstairs!

You hold and climb with trembling hips

As pee dribbles through your fingertips

Then suddenly inside the bathroom door

There is a spatter on the floor

You freeze and stand with legs spread wide

There’s no way now to stop the tide

The room fills with a resounding hiss

As your knickers quickly fill with piss

You can clean up at your leisure

The relief gave you orgasmic pleasure

Don’t be angry or upset

Even if you’re soaking wet

You did everything within your power

Now you really need a shower

While you’re in there stop and think

About how many cups of tea you drink!
