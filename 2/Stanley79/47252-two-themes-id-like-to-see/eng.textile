From real life -- High school girls have cousins visiting for USA Thanksgiving. They take the cousins with them to conservative church Friday evening service (promising it won't be too bad. Reason the teens attend the music part of the main service. Then the school age gets dismissed to the various school rooms. Except getting lost, they end up in the coffee house kitty-corner from the church. (In real life they get lost and show up here every Wed, Fri and Sun evening. Usually only the girls have such a bad sense of direction.) Anyway, they order drinks and forty minutes later they start visiting the restrooms. With the extra cousins along the lines were longer this evening.

From Maid for TV about 1994 -- Without Warning: When an asteroid crashes into north eastern Wyoming, reporter Bree Walker rushes to the local CBS affiliate to board the station's Helicopter and supply commentary while her photographer attempts live video. First interference disrupts the connection. Then a wildfire covers most of the scene with black clouds. As the clouds keep shifting the Bree, the pilot and the photographer seek clear camera shots. The pilot and camera operator are male. As new twists to the story become known, Bree must stay airborne to commentary going.
