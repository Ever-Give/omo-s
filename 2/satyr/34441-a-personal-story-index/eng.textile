This is a bit of a self-serving post, and perhaps a little presumptuous, but I've but a lot of effort into writing stories over the years. Most of them very well received. Unfortunately, a lot of them are now just sitting there in the archives, unread. We've had a lot of new members since I first started. So, at the risk of looking like an attention-seeker, I decided to make a thread with a collection of my omo stories over the years. I'd put a link in my signature but I'm not sure if the new forum even allows that!

I'll also let you chime in on what you're most interested in, and I'll take it into consideration for future writings. Without further ado:

Wayward Girl

My latest story, still right there at the top of the page. Contains desperation, wetting, domination, and light ABDL content. I swear that last part is creeping more and more into my writing, but I do intend to write more pure omo. This is the story of a couple working out how to fit their kinks together. It's quite romantic.

En Aulidi

Ongoing story which I will finish, I promise. It takes place in a post-apocalyptic weird world of my own making, with themes from Ancient Greek mythology. Contains ABDL content.

An Innocent Autocomplete Suggestion

Cute little story about a girl who finds out her crush is into omo and uses it to seduce him. Written based on a request. Pure omo.

Potty Timer

A story of forced bladder control. Contains D/s themes.

Roses

The story of a prostitute and a very special customer. Contains ABDL themes.

WTF is that?

One time, as a little girl, Nora wet the bed at her aunt's. Now an adult and visiting with her boyfriend, her aunt hasn't forgotten. Her boyfriend won't let her forget either, as they go on an adventure around the small town.

My most daring escapade yet. Hot girls, beer, and one full bladder!

This is a true story, involving me, a desperately full bladder, and hot girls flirting with me in a bar. Contains pics/video, if you're into male wetting. I'm mostly into the watching myself, girls in particular, but once in a while I get frisky (oh, so lonely), and this time it got hotter than expected.

Developmental Biology

This is a series of stories in a universe in which girls don't potty train until their teens. There's several episodes, and most of them are finished... Last one I kind of left hanging, unfortunately. I really love this universe and I want to do something more with it, but I do have other stories (and real life) on my plate. Since girls don't potty train until later in life, naturally some padding is involved, but it's handled in a mature way. No babying.

Omo Microfiction

This thread is a collection of super-short omorashi stories. Other people joined in with their attempts at microfiction as well. Very much bite-sized, as opposed to my usual wordiness.

The Calendar Sisters

May and June are twin sisters. May goads her sister into a holding contest on a road trip, and things don't go as planned. Their older sister and cousin also get involved, although I don't want to spoil things too much.

Mass Desperation on a High School Trip

This is a supposedly true story which was posted on another forum a long time ago. I am not the original author, but translated it from Norwegian.

Christmas in Neon City

An attempt at a cyberpunk story set during Christmas-time.

Yes, it's possible.

A rather short story about an accident at the office.

The Decameron

A group of refugees from a terrible virus entertain each other with omorashi stories. I know a lot of people wanted me to continue this story, and believe me, so did I. But I kind of ran into writer's block here. Perhaps one day I'll get back to it, but don't hold your breath. The story is structured as a collective telling each other nesting stories, so even though the frame story is incomplete, there should be plenty there to entertain and arouse you.

Life sucks, and then you die.

A depressed girl finds relief in desperation.

Wheel of Fortune: A Superposition of Stories

An experimental story with three different endings, like a wheel of fortune. You can choose to pick one at random, or read each one. Concerns too sisters going to a fair with their parents. The older of them has a nasty habit of putting it off.

A Sisterly Rivalry

My very first story posted on this forum. Again, we have one sister who puts it off, and a younger sister who's more sensible. Both end up in trouble. Personally, I think it's quite sweet.

A Belated Halloween Special

ABDL-themed Halloween story from last year, posted elsewhere. I actually wrote one this year too for a contest, but I wasn't quite happy with it and never did publish that one.

That should be it. All my omo-related fiction collected in one place. Looking back at it, there's a whole lot of it. I will be continuing my current serial (En Aulidi), but I write when inspiration and/or arousal strikes, so maybe there will be other stories in-between.

I want to hear what you think. I feel so vain for saying this, but I've written a ton and gotten some love for it. I'm not fishing for compliments, merely for future inspiration. If you've read some of my stories, what did you like and what would you like to see in future stories? I don't write fanfiction, period. I make my own worlds. Other than that, I have done various kinds of stories, although they all sprung from my own fantasies. I want to do a little Christmas special one-shot this year. Perhaps set in the Developmental Biology universe, since that one's quite well-developed--although I know some people run away screaming when nappies appear, even if only the threat of it.

If you've read some of my stuff and liked it, perhaps there's something more for you to enjoy above. In any case, let me know! There's nothing an author loves more than feedback - except money. But I'm not charging any for this!

Thank you!! Yeah, I honestly don't know how abdl somehow slips into so many stories these days. I have a plan for a Christmas story set in the "Developmental Biology" universe, which is not abdl but definitely dl territory. After that, there's the combo omo/abdl story I'm writing as a serial, then we'll see. I know a lot of people have certain personal kinks and don't enjoy mixing too much... What can I say,, I write what I like to read. I'm gonna consciously move onto more "pure omo" stuff when my current storylines are complete.

Again, much thanks! I always try to create a story, not just fapfiction. Excuse my inequovelnce, I'm on my way to get drunk and meet old friends. I'll have a new story for you before New Year's, I'm pretty sure. Again, thanks! I don't understand people's tastes sometimes either. :))

It's been a year since I made this thread, and I'm sad to say I haven't been as active this year due to various personal issues. Lately I've been getting back into writing, but it comes and it goes... Sometimes I will write two stories in a week, sometimes I will go six months without one. I don't think it's too rude to bump a thread once a year, to bring attention to older stories you may have missed, and to update on what's been going on since then.

I'll also let you chime in on what you're most interested in, and I'll take it into consideration for future writings. Without further ado:

I Warned You!

My most recent story, still on the frontpage. This is one of my ultimate fantasies - a girl with a fantastic bladder who is too proud to admit she has to go, and eventually learns that everyone has their limits. Pure omo, alternate ending for the messing fans.

Out of the Question!

A very recent story with ABDL themes, hosted on a different board. My take on the classic "younger sister wears diapers, older sister has an experience of her own" theme.

@@omofiction

My infrequently updated tumblr blog. Contains a few short stories not posted elsewhere, as well as some reblogged pictures and videos.

3 Facts About You

A friend sets our protagonist up for an unforgettable encounter with a cute girl by giving him, and her, each three facts about the other.

Wayward Girl

Contains desperation, wetting, domination, and light ABDL content. I swear that last part is creeping more and more into my writing, but I do intend to write more pure omo. This is the story of a couple working out how to fit their kinks together. It's quite romantic.

En Aulidi

An apocalyptic sci-fi re-telling of the Trojan war, with an omorashi twist. This setting had a ton of promise, and last year I made a solemn promise to finish it, but unfortunately, it is on indefinite hold. Still, I think you might enjoy it, unfinished as it is.

An Innocent Autocomplete Suggestion

Cute little story about a girl who finds out her crush is into omo and uses it to seduce him. Written based on a request. Pure omo.

Potty Timer

A story of forced bladder control. Contains D/s themes.

Roses

Nonfiction

Although I've unfortunately not had that many exciting real-life omo experiences, I have written a little bit of nonfiction as well.

Mass Desperation on a High School Trip

This is a supposedly true story which was posted on another forum a long time ago. I am not the original author, but translated it from Swedish. I suspect this might be embellished, but it was presented as a true story. I'm considering translating some more of my favorite non-English stories. The thread also contains another short, supposedly true story in translation.

Serial Pisser on the Loose!

A true, somewhat tragic news story of a serial-pissing woman terrorizing Oslo's public transport system with deliberate wettings. She's even gone to prison for it several times, and caused thousands of dollars in property damage.

Some real stats about wetting from science journals

This is a well-researched post about all things incontinence, with numerous sources from legitimate academic papers.

My Most Daring Escapade Yet: Hot Girls, Beer, and One Full Bladder!

I rarely do holds myself--I prefer to watch or read about others doing them--but this is a rare instance of me holding it in public, in a bar, while flirting with hot girls. Contains pics/video, if you're into male wetting.

Based On a True Story

The title is somewhat of a lie: this is a short series of stories about real-life experiences I've had or witnessed, but freely embellished. Call it somewhere between fact and fiction, although to be clear it is posted in the fiction section, lest anyone accuse me of making stuff up.

Promising Situations

Again, I've been unfortunate not to witness any serious adult accidents in real life. This thread was one of the first I made on these forums, and describes some very promising and somewhat arousing situations I witnessed or heard about, but which never reached their sexiest conclusion (at least not in my presence).
