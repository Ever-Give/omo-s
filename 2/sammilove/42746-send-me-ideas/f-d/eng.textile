I need ideas. I want to write another fiction story during my time off but I need ideas. Anyone care to pm me some? Can be about anything but would prefer it be female cause that’s my topic of expertise.

Hmm that could work but I feel like I write about that a lot. Other ideas?

I literally found that after I made this. Figured it would’ve gotten deleted already.

That does sound kinda hot but I’ve never thought about a story about that topic.

So I think I may an have idea for the story. Character ideas or I should I use myself as the lead?
